Therefore, one precondition for species to survive and pass on offspring is by having or inheriting beneficial variations. This variation and selection process explains how we get the diversity of species we see today.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In both examples, mere assemblage simply lists an undifferentiated series of findings in succession. In contrast, a synthesis of the hypothetical set of findings in both cases, weaves them together into something greater than the sum of the parts: in the system paper example, a theory of change for what the most fruitful angle of attack is for making progress on a problem; in the latter example, a full-blown causal theory of the origin of species!</p><p>You would be surprised at how common this &ldquo;phone book&rdquo; mere assemblage pattern is in academic literature reviews, from doctoral dissertations, even ones that pass!
