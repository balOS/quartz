The overarching goal of the Underlay project is to create a distributed public knowledge graph
… underlying all such developments is the core idea of using graphs to represent data… The result is most often used in application scenarios that involve integrating, managing and extracting value from diverse sources of data at large scale … we view a knowledge graph as a graph of data intended to accumulate and convey knowledge of the real world, whose nodes represent entities of interest and whose edges represent relations between these entities</description></item></channel></rss>
