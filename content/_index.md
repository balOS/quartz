Welcome to our living hypertext notebook. This notebook will continue to evolve going into the future and is by no means a finished product- as such, pages exist at varying stages of completion. Please leave comments to further the discussion and help direct its evolution.

**All you need to do is click on what is interesting.** This is a special trait of this website - hypertext notebooks are designed for exploratory browsing. In a linear piece of writing, all ideas would be sequenced into one narrative. In hypertext writing, the narrative is emergent and the ideas are associative. It is like a book where the pages rearrange themselves for you based on your current curiosity each time you revisit. *For more on what this is, see [[Q- What is a hypertext notebook]]?*  

The goal of this research project is to find data structures and interfaces that support synthesis and innovation in a decentralized discourse graph. *See: [[Q- What is a decentralized discourse graph]]*

Some specific how-tos:
- Pages have prefixes in their page titles that indicate what type of node it is:
	- "C- " Claim
	- "Q- " Question
	- "R- " Resource
	- "I- " Idea
- Hover your mouse over a link to see a preview of its content
- If a page is empty, look through its backlinks! If a page isn't empty... you can still look through its backlinks! Those are all of the times where the ideas presented in the page were used in context.
- If a page is not yet created, the hyperlink will appear to be faded.
- Builders: View this as a framework for navigating the [idea maze](https://cdixon.org/2013/08/04/the-idea-maze), and form your own conclusions about the claims, questions, and trails between them.

Some suggested starting points:
- For broader context about what we are doing:
	- [[C- Discourse graphs could significantly accelerate human synthesis work]]
	- [[Q- What is a decentralized discourse graph]]
	- [[C- Synthesis is hard to do with people who donâ€™t share context with you]]
	- [[Research Grant Application]]
- To begin with key questions:
	- [[Q- What user behaviors are people doing already that imply structure that is not being instantiated into a literal structure]]
	- [[Q- What are powerful interfaces for entering information into a discourse graph]]
	- [[Q- What are powerful primitives for a user of a decentralized knowledge graph]]
- To jump straight into the ideas:
	- [[I- Search as a part of the primitive design]]
	- [[I- A DSL for a discourse graph with information entry, visualization, and retrieval]]
	- [[structure now vs. later (uncertain payoff, regret)]]
