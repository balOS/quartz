Welcome to the decentralized discourse graph hypertext notebook. This notebook will continue to evolve going into the future and is by no means a finished product. Please leave comments to further the discussion and help direct its evolution.

All you need to do is click on what is interesting. This is a special trait of this website - hypertext notebooks are designed for exploratory browsing. In a linear piece of writing, all ideas would be sequenced into one narrative. In hypertext writing, the narrative is emergent and the ideas are associative. It is like a book where the pages rearrange themselves for you based on your current curiosity each time you revisit. For more on what this is, see [[Q- What is a hypertext notebook]]?

The goal of this research project is to find data structures and interfaces that support synthesis and innovation in a decentralized discourse graph. See: [[Q- What is a decentralized discourse graph]]?

Some specific how-tos:
- Hover your mouse over a link to see a preview of its content.
- If a page is empty, look through its backlinks! 
- If a page isn't empty... you can still look through its backlinks! Those are all of the times where the ideas presented in the page were used in context.
- If a page is not yet created, the hyperlink will appear to be faded.
- Command+k or ctrl+k to search

Builders: View this as a framework for navigating the idea maze, and form your own conclusions about the claims, questions, and trails between them.


Some suggested starting points:
For broader context about what we are doing:
- [[C- Discourse graphs could significantly accelerate human synthesis work]]
- [[Q- What is a decentralized discourse graph]]
- [[Research Grant Application]]

To begin with key questions:
- [[Q- What user behaviors are people doing already that imply structure that is not being instantiated into a literal structure]]
- [[Q- What are powerful interfaces for entering information into a discourse graph]]
- [[Q- What are powerful primitives for a user of a decentralized knowledge graph]]

To jump straight into the ideas:
- [[I- Search as a part of the primitive design]]
- [[I- A DSL for a discourse graph with information entry, visualization, and retrieval]]
