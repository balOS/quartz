Welcome to the decentralized discourse graph hypertext notebook. This notebook will continue to evolve over the course of the entire project and is by no means a finished product.

**All you need to do is click on what is interesting.** This is a special trait of this website - hypertext notebooks are designed for exploratory browsing. In a linear piece of writing, all ideas would be sequenced into one narrative. In hypertext writing, the narrative is emergent and the ideas are associative. It is like a book where the pages rearrange themselves for you based on your current curiosity each time you revisit. *For more on what this is, see [[Q- What is a hypertext notebook]]?* ^0Q4ntx

The goal of this research project is to find data structures and interfaces that support synthesis and innovation in a decentralized discourse graph. *See: [[Q- What is a decentralized discourse graph]]*

Some suggested starting points:
- For broader context about what we are doing:
	- [[C- Discourse graphs could significantly accelerate human synthesis work]]
	- [[Q- What is a decentralized discourse graph]]
	- [[Research Grant Application]]
- To begin with key questions:
	- [[Q- What user behaviors are people doing already that imply structure that is not being instantiated into a literal structure]]
	- [[Q- What are powerful interfaces for entering information into a discourse graph]]
	- [[Q- What are powerful primitives for a user of a decentralized knowledge graph]]
- To jump straight into the ideas:
	- [[content/garden/LitReview/I- Search as a part of the primitive design]]
	- [[I- A DSL for a discourse graph with information entry, visualization, and retrieval]]

- Some specific how-tos:
	- Hover your mouse over a link to see a preview of its content
	- If a page is empty, look through its backlinks! If a page isn't empty... you can still look through its backlinks! Those are all of the times where the ideas presented in the page were used in context.
