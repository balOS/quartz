- As mentioned on [I- Replace the backlinks section of a page with a related items section](I-%20Replace%20the%20backlinks%20section%20of%20a%20page%20with%20a%20related%20items%20section.md), [C- Linked references are a smart default for related items](C-%20Linked%20references%20are%20a%20smart%20default%20for%20related%20items.md) but are not a complete description of what is related. The exclusive use of backlinks to define a related items section leads to the problems outlined on [Q- How do we solve the problem of different people referring to the same concept with different language](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/Q-%20How%20do%20we%20solve%20the%20problem%20of%20different%20people%20referring%20to%20the%20same%20concept%20with%20different%20language.md)
- While [populating the related items section through a search term]([I- Populate the related items section through a search term](I-%20Populate%20the%20related%20items%20section%20through%20a%20search%20term.md)) solves that problem with precision, editing the search term would likely require a decent amount of effort. [Agora](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/Tools%20for%20Thought%20Examples/Agora.md) provides an ergonomic solution with their Push and Pull mechanisms.
- Within [Agora](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/Tools%20for%20Thought%20Examples/Agora.md), if you are writing on a page and believe the backlinks for another page would be relevant, you can write `[pull](pull) [page2](page2)`. Push does the opposite, pushing backlinks from the page you are writing on to another page's backlinks section.
- For example, imagine you have a page called `[Graph Core Protocol Development Teams](Graph%20Core%20Protocol%20Development%20Teams)`. On that page, you could `pull` references to each team into the related items section of development teams page. The search term that populates the related items section would adjust in response to uses of `push` and `pull`, looking something like *(syntax isn't final)* `(any: [Graph Core Protocol Development Team](Graph%20Core%20Protocol%20Development%20Team) [Edge & Node](Edge%20&%20Node) [Figment](Figment) [Semiotic.ai](Semiotic.ai) [StreamingFast](StreamingFast) [The Guild](The%20Guild))`
