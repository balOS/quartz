- This one is simple - if we can use search as the basis for other features, and we can [map some action onto all of the search results]([Q- How might we apply map filter reduce to notes and what other primitives are relevant to this domain](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/Q-%20How%20might%20we%20apply%20map%20filter%20reduce%20to%20notes%20and%20what%20other%20primitives%20are%20relevant%20to%20this%20domain.md)). For example, we might search for all claims and then make all wikilinks green.
