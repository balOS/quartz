This is closely related to the question: [[Q- How might we make it so it doesn't matter if user behavior is inconsistent]]. There is a fundamental tension with notes that are intended for your future self where it's impossible to know exactly what your future self will need all of the time... so you need to be able to refactor and [[structure in hindsight]].

For example, let's say that we suddenly decide "Let's not categorize our notes with prefixes in the titles. Instead, let's do it with tags." How could someone refactor everything to current needs without manually going through everything one by one? [[Q- How can people maintain a decentralized discourse graph with a high quantity of information in it]]

There can be an intense amount of FOMO and friction that comes from thinking that you need to plan everything ahead of time. This is one of the problems with [[Notion]] - it's really hard to refactor systems so people feel like they can't start before they have it all figured out. It is a big friction for [[new users]].

One can reduce this friction through:
	- [[C- Incrementally processing notes is a key user behavior to promote synthesis]]
	- [[C- Reviewing past notes in the process of creating new notes is a key user behavior to promote synthesis]]

[[C- End user programming enables people to bulk process notes]]
