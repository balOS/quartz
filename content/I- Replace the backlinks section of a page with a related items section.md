- We can [[I- Populate the related items section through a search term.md]]. Since [[C- Linked references are a smart default for related items.md]], linked references should be the default search term so users don't have to do additional manual work to make the related items section useful. To give users a low friction way to edit the search term for a page's related items, we can [[I- Provide Push and Pull as inline syntax to affect the related items section for a page.md]].
- This could [[I- Enable composable queries to facilitate structure in hindsight.md]]. Because users struggle with the dilemma to [[uncertain payoff, regret)](structure now vs. later (uncertain payoff, regret|structure now vs. later (uncertain payoff, regret)]]), a query with related items affords a user the chance to add structure indirectly, and in the moment of ambient review. We suspect this will reduce system entropy over time.
- Given that search terms can be defined to bring in a broader array of stuff than a simple list of backlinks, users will require a way to filter their results. As described in [[Interfaces for adjusting a query.md]], this does not all need to occur through text entry.
