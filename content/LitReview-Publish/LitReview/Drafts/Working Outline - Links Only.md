This is a working outline of the handoff for The Graph. This page should ultimately be reduced to a table of contents, if anything. 

##### Entry Point
**About these notes** (3-5 paragraphs pointing readers in direction they can go)
- this is the project (links to description, goals, success)
- move into key open questions

##### Outline Page (from Meeting)
This is what we discussed during the meeting on 2021-09-22, but it remains slightly incomplete.
1. [[Q- What is a decentralized discourse graph]]
2. [[Q- What community roles are necessary in a decentralized knowledge graph]]
3. [[C- Synthesis as a process is usefully modeled as a specialized form of sensemaking]]
4. [[LitReview/LitReview/Q- What workflows and behaviors facilitate synthesis]] + [[LitReview/Q- What workflows and behaviors facilitate synthesis]] 
	1. [ ] - [[Todos for Rob]] merge/resolve these two pages.
5. [[LitReview/Drafts/Q- What are powerful interfaces for entering information into a discourse graph]]
	1. [ ] [[Todos for Rob]] explore the social network aspect 
6. [[I- A DSL for a discourse graph with information entry, visualization, and retrieval]]
	1. [ ] [[Todos for Rob]] work on the graphical side of authoring.

##### Suggested Outline
This is a suggestion based on the content we have right now. All other links would be placed in the *Extended Universe* folder (name TBD)
1. [[Q- What is a decentralized discourse graph]]
2. [[LitReview/Q- What is synthesis]]
3. [[C- Synthesis as a process is usefully modeled as a specialized form of sensemaking]]
4. [[C- Discourse graphs could significantly accelerate human synthesis work]]
5. [[LitReview/Q- What workflows and behaviors facilitate synthesis]]
6. [[LitReview/Drafts/Q- What are powerful interfaces for entering information into a discourse graph]]
7. [[I- A DSL for a discourse graph with information entry, visualization, and retrieval]]
8. [[Migrated/I- Search as a part of the primitive design]]
9. [[Main/C- Most people will primarily consume information]]
10. [[Q- What community roles are necessary in a decentralized knowledge graph]]
