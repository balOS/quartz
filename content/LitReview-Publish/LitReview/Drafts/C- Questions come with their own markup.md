> Questions are places in your mind where answers fit. If you haven’t asked the question, the answer has nowhere to go. It hits your mind and bounces right off. You have to ask the question – you have to want to know – in order to open up the space for the answer to fit.

> Questions are living knowledge. To use a programming analogy, if facts are like data, then questions are like functions- when you ask the question in different contexts with different information  it generates different answers.
