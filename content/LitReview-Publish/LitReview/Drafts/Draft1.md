### The goal of this research

- The goal of this research project is to find data structures and interfaces that support synthesis and innovation in a decentralized discourse graph. *See: [[Q- What is a decentralized discourse graph]]*

[[Q- What is synthesis|What is synthesis]]? 

Synthesis is a creative act. It involves creating a new whole out of component parts. This can come in many forms:
- Generalizing a principle over many instances
- Abstracting a new theory to frame many concepts
- Exaptation

- Some examples of interdisciplinary synthesis include:
	- Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky recognized a claim made by economists that people behaved rationally and questioned it. The rational actor model had long been assumed to be true in economics. They then studied the question through the lens of judgment and decision. Amos Tversky, always the militant debater, would challenge economists to rationalize their findings. This led to the beginning of a new field: **Behavioral Economics**
		- Much of the discourse in DisciplineA rests on AssumptionA. Participants in the discourse graph for DisciplineB call AssumptionA into question through the evidence and claims of GraphDisciplineB. 
		- In the effort of refuting AssumptionA, they found the areas where DisciplineA and DisciplineB were [[Q- How do we solve the problem of different people referring to the same concept with different language|discussing the same questions with different language.]]
		- If you picture a venn diagram, behavioral economics is the intersection between economic and behavioral science theory / evidence 
	- [[P- Vitalik Buterin]] et al. recognizing that the blockchain could support full programmability and innovating smart contracts through Ethereum. There were further acts of synthesis when specific futures were envisioned, like an alternative to DNS. 
	- The scaling solutions in the plan for Ethereum 2.0, with Proof of Stake, Sharding, and Layer 2, is an act of synthesis. They combined many sources of information to solve a problem, emphasizing only the most important bits, where the solutions work together synergistically.
	- Cryptoeconomics is the combination of cryptography and economics for the goal of social coordination towards desirable outcomes. 

Example Problems
- SEC is making hands on decisions on a case by case basis with specific companies. The discourse is not made clear to stakeholders. 
	- One process is combative research. Where you agree to research a question together, and you both get to ask each other questions. Right now it's an interrogation. How do conflicting viewpoints come together and combine to form a new set of beliefs and decisions?

How do you push discourse forward such that it can be brought together easily when synthesis is required or desired?
