This is part of the [[Todo List for LitReview]]. As of 2021-09-14, we have not yet decided on a final approach. 

Current options:
1. Build only in the LitReview folder and copy all files to be held within. 
2. Build only in the LitReview folder and move all tagged files within.
3. Share the entire vault and place empty pages in WIP folder. 
4. Share the entire vault and build out a flowchart.fun for empty pages. 

To this point, [[Brendan Langen]] has moved files through the first question of the [[Initial Outline]] into the Linked References folder. Images will be added to Resources.

Warning from Plugin: Don't forget that creating the file from here may create the file in the wrong directory!
