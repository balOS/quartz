[[Q- What are powerful primitives for a user of a decentralized knowledge graph]]

Example: Person **P** in setting **S** wants to achieve goal **G** but obstacles **O**[1 to n] get in the way. Any solution has to: satisfy constraints **X**[1 to n], minimize costs **Y**[1 to n], and avoid obstacles **Z**[1 to n]. As designers, we bring the following principles and constraints **A**[1 to n]. Our approach, **{approach},** has characteristics **C**[1 to n] that help stakeholders achieve their goal **G** while avoiding obstacles **O**[1 to n].

Example: The major knowledge to be gained from development research is in the form of (both substantive and methodological) 'design principles' to support designers in their task. Those principles are usually heuristic statements of a format such as "If you want to deign intervention **X**, for the purpose/function **Y** in context **Z**, then you are best advised to give that intervention the characteristics **A**, **B**, and **C** substantive emphasis and to do that via procedures **K**, **L**, and **M** [procedural emphasis], because of arugments **P**, **Q**, and **R**." (p. 9)
