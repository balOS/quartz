The primary reason that [[P- Gordon Brander]] is building [[Subtext]] on a block-based [line-by-line data structure](https://subconscious.substack.com/p/subtext-markup-for-note-taking) is because he wants to make his notes easy to parse and script. [[Markdown]] is notoriously difficult for machines to parse. Additionally, [[P- Flancian]] mentioned to me in a conversation that outlines are easier to parse than documents because computers are good at parsing tree structures.

Additionally, I have long held that [[end-user programming]] is crucial for a proper tool for thought. If it is difficult to parse the data that the user produces, we can't expect them to program that data. If we are able to have blocks that have clearly defined relationships with each other, then I believe we will be able to fulfill that requirement.
