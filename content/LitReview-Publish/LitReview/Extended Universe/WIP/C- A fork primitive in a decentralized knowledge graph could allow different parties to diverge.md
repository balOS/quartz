##### Work in Progress
#WIP

I have a hunch that we need some way to let you query the whole chain of forks, not just the fork itself. If you're gonna play telephone with ideas over time, we need to be able to follow the changes.

In Roam, you can reference a block into another block, and then reference the new block. However, when you reference the new block, the chain back to the original block is not maintained. 

To solve a separate problem, there can be a merge primitive for when [[Q- How do we solve the problem of different people referring to the same concept with different language]]. Look for my stuff on how I want to query changes made in forks.

Imagine that we have multiplicity of beliefs about one thing. [[C- Multiplicity is necessary for synthesis]]

> I’ll restate the problem with TokenPage: there is a tension between groups such as Yankees fans, Red Sox fans (AKA Yankees haters), and those who just want to maintain accurate knowledge, which bids up the price of a TokenPage orthogonally to the page’s intrinsic value, and may lead to wild swings in the page content when ownership changes hands. This does seem fun, to be honest. On the other hand, stability seems like a core attribute of a system that people will use for building knowledge. As mentioned, Wikipedia has achieved something like this by maintaining strong norms, but it leaves out emerging knowledge that hasn’t yet met that criteria.
> 
> Another approach would be to let a thousand communities bloom and govern their own idea of accurate knowledge. Hence our third and final CCKM approach, TribePages. In the world of TribePages, we’ve accepted that different communities may have differences in accepted knowledge about a topic.
> 
> Suppose now that we use the domain tribe.page. Each community can have a subdomain, such as yankees.tribe.page. Now the same idea of TokenPage applies where a given topic has the community-approved knowledge for that page at {community}.tribe.page/{title}.
> 
> Additional affordances are added at the user level. A user can subscribe to many communities. Then, when browsing tribe.page/{title}, they would see a result among any subscribed communities. If communities have conflicting page content, it can show a diff view. Likewise, a user could specifically seek the diffs between two communities to compare their views on a topic.
> 
> Community subdomains can be governed as a DAO. The DAO can receive money by membership fees, RefGold, or by using TokenPage-like NFTs to award ownership of each page to an individual user.
> 
> Who would create such a community? Yankees fans are an example with a clear demarcation: what baseball team do you like? However, other communities may be more nebulous. For example, a task force may form to understand the pros and cons of a COVID vaccine booster shot. If this community faces an impasse on their foundational knowledge assumptions, they may choose to fork into new communities. (Pages of text with unchanging assumptions are easy enough to copy over.)
