It's important to note that at the scale of a decentralized discourse graph, the sheer quantity of stuff becomes a potentially crushing constraint. At this level, people might be unwilling to process items one at a time.

This might be relatively straightforward in a [[I- A DSL for a discourse graph with information entry, visualization, and retrieval]].

[[Q- How can people maintain a decentralized discourse graph with a high quantity of information in it]]? [[C- Incrementally processing notes is a key user behavior to promote synthesis]], because that's way easier than processing everything all at once.

[[Q- What community roles are necessary in a decentralized knowledge graph]]? One of the key benefits of a decentralized knowledge graph is that you can distribute the labor of synthesis among many people. Bulk refactors are another way to reduce the [[user effort investment]].

[[Q- How might we allow people to adapt their past system and notes to current needs]]? This problem becomes especially important as more people are added into the social knowledge graph, because now you don't just have individuals changing over time. The whole cast of participants changes periodically, so past systems need to update to new contributors! If users are limited to one-at-a-time edits, then systems become unnecessarily tedious to update.
