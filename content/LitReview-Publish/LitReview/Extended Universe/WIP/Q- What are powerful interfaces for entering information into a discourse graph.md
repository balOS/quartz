## [[I- A DSL for a discourse graph with information entry, visualization, and retrieval]]
[[Mermaid diagrams]] have a syntax for making diagrams that I won't go into too much detail about here, suffice to say it is too complex but still interesting. One does wonder... what would a discourse graph made of many mermaid diagrams composed into one through page and block references look like?

Text doesn't need to be the only form of information entry. Perhaps you can edit a graph directly, or use a table as a block to indicate item/attribute relationships. [[C- A structural editor could allow people to make and edit data structures]].

## Graphical interfaces

[[C- A structural editor can make a DSL approachable to end-users]]

[[Extended Universe/Tools for Thought Examples/Notion|Notion]] has many interfaces for entering data into a table
[[TheBrain]]. [[P- Matt Goldenberg]] wrote something about this, and probably has videos.

[[Kosmik]] is pretty impressive. They essentially try to merge Figma, a file system, and hypermedia, but they are very early.

Visual thinking is underexplored. For example, see an intermediate deliverable for my work with GuidedTrack. Instead of presenting an essay, I shared this Figma board.

This style of Figma board could easily be worked into a DSL so people could edit it visually or textually. It wouldn't take much to turn Figma into a full blown tool for thought. A query engine could find information based on how close one visual object is to another and present the results in multiple formats. I'll add more concrete descriptions here. [[Todos for Rob]]
