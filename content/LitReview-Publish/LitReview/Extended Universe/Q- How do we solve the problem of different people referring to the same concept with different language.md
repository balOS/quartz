One time I was in [a conversation](https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1256294495919828992?s=20) with [[P- Andy Matuschak]] on Twitter, where we ended up having a conversation through our notes. He linked to a note about what we can learn from game design, and then I linked to a note about the learning curve that's commonly seen in puzzle games, and then he linked to a note about cognitive scaffolding. It was interesting because I had actually encountered his thought about cognitive scaffolding before, but I hadn't drawn the connection that we were talking about the same thing with different language! A knowledge graph that naively uses linkages to the same term wouldn't capture this connection.
