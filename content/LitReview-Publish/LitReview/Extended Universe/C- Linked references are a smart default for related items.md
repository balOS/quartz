I've tweeted about this before.

[When you think about it](https://twitter.com/RobertHaisfield/status/1379128190409449472), the backlinks to` [[page]]` being a search for `"[[page]]"` essentially represents a smart default for what is related to that page within your vault. I want to break those defaults and further define what counts as a "backlink" via a well-formed search term!

This point was also made by [[P- Gordon Brander]], taking inspiration from [[Notational Velocity]]. As he phrases it in [Search reveals useful dimensions in latent idea space](https://subconscious.substack.com/p/search-reveals-useful-dimensions):

> **Any sufficiently advanced search is indistinguishable from a hyperlink**. A search query is kind of like a hyperlink that can be constructed on the fly. Our question forges a link between notes, just-in-time. When a search becomes extremely specific, it functions like a coordinate to a specific point in latent idea space.

Treating searches as though they are backlinks is a really powerful idea. That means you can make more precise searches as a way of filtering it down. Also makes me want to alter the search for backlinks to define it more to my liking.

I remember how my mind was blown when I first saw [[P- Allen Wilsonn]] link a tweet [to a search](https://twitter.com/AGWilsonn/status/1265760007414579206). This was just an early example of a powerful new behavior.
