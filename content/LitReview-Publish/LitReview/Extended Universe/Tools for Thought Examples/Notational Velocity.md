Notational Velocity is a Mac OS [[Open source]] note storage and retrieval app based around advanced search functionality. In their model, the same interface is used for creating notes and searching, which enables related past thoughts to generate alongside typed content. 

Notational Velocity's structure implies an evergreen or permanent note taking structure similar to [[Zettelkasten]] or [[P- Andy Matuschak]]'s approaches.
