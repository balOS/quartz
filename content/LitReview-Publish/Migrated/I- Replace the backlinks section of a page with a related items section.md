- We can [I- Populate the related items section through a search term](I-%20Populate%20the%20related%20items%20section%20through%20a%20search%20term.md). Since [C- Linked references are a smart default for related items](C-%20Linked%20references%20are%20a%20smart%20default%20for%20related%20items.md), linked references should be the default search term so users don't have to do additional manual work to make the related items section useful. To give users a low friction way to edit the search term for a page's related items, we can [I- Provide Push and Pull as inline syntax to affect the related items section for a page](I-%20Provide%20Push%20and%20Pull%20as%20inline%20syntax%20to%20affect%20the%20related%20items%20section%20for%20a%20page.md).
- This could [I- Enable composable queries to facilitate structure in hindsight](I-%20Enable%20composable%20queries%20to%20facilitate%20structure%20in%20hindsight.md). Because users struggle with the dilemma to [structure now vs. later (uncertain payoff, regret)](structure%20now%20vs.%20later%20(uncertain%20payoff,%20regret)), a query with related items affords a user the chance to add structure indirectly, and in the moment of ambient review. We suspect this will reduce system entropy over time.
- Given that search terms can be defined to bring in a broader array of stuff than a simple list of backlinks, users will require a way to filter their results. As described in [Interfaces for adjusting a query](Interfaces%20for%20adjusting%20a%20query.md), this does not all need to occur through text entry.
