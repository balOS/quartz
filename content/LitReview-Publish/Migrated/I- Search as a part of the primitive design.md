- Currently in notebook:
    - There are few things that are more expressive than a search. [C- Search terms express intentions](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/C-%20Search%20terms%20express%20intentions.md)!
    - [C- Linked references are a smart default for related items](C-%20Linked%20references%20are%20a%20smart%20default%20for%20related%20items.md). This is actually quite a conservative idea- if a block of text or a page has the same set of words as those present in the title of a page, then it's probably related. However, what if people could tweak the rules of what's considered relevant to a page? Through logical operators like AND, OR, NOT, and IF, people are able to express precisely what they consider relevant and in which contexts. How people fit information into the data structure of discourse graph should make them feel like they are building a conversation partner. Queries are how you can turn [your past notes into a conversation partner](https://subconscious.substack.com/p/notes-are-conversations-across-time). "What have I thought about already on this subject? I see... these 3 results make sense in my current context, and raise another question..."
    - See, for example, how I map Roam queries to English questions so I'm able to find an answer [in minutes 20-30 of this video](https://youtu.be/47A0gK7Vo8E?t=1200). Those questions did not have a set of backlinks because there was no single page to backlink to! Even if I created a new page, the backlinks would be empty until after I had searched through my notes and manually added references to the question page. By creating a query, I was able to say: "All blocks that match these rules are relevant to this question." Effectively, this enabled me to process past notes in bulk. [C- A decentralized discourse graph is dynamic](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/WIP/C-%20A%20decentralized%20discourse%20graph%20is%20dynamic.md), and wrangling past data into new slots through search is one way to answer the question: [Q- How might we allow people to adapt their past system and notes to current needs](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/Q-%20How%20might%20we%20allow%20people%20to%20adapt%20their%20past%20system%20and%20notes%20to%20current%20needs.md)?
    - The above example points towards another powerful use for queries: Smart folders.
    - Most file systems require you to manually add files into different folders. Keeping these folders up to date can be a challenging job. The same problem holds true for note taking apps where you need to manually place a tag or bidirectional link in order to put ideas into buckets. [In Apple's Finder](https://www.howtogeek.com/403077/how-to-automate-your-mac-with-smart-folders/), you have the ability to create smart folders. These smart folders are populated by the results of a search, so it autoupdates when new content is added to your file system. In essence, this enables you to create organization systems now to capture knowledge in the future.
    - However, search terms alone are not sufficient. People do not always know how to express what they are looking for. In that case, we have exploratory search and browsing *(see [Search Behavior](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/Search%20Behavior.md)).* They will need navigational aids as well.
    - Wikis are one such navigational aid. [Through hypertext](https://robhaisfield.com/notes/writing-in-hypertext), wikis enable people to seamlessly jump from page to page. People often compete in [Wikiraces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikirace) where they have to go from a random article to a specific one as quickly as they can by only clicking on hyperlinks. These have become even more popular lately in [digital gardens](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden). Some examples include [P- Andy Matuschak](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/People/P-%20Andy%20Matuschak.md)'s [working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes), my personal public [hypertext notebook](https://robhaisfield.com/about), and a more recent [academic literature review example by Matt Clancy](https://www.newthingsunderthesun.com/about) on innovation economics.
    - Bidirectional links are another aid. As stated by [P- Andy Matuschak](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/People/P-%20Andy%20Matuschak.md):
    - > Systems which display backlinks to a node permit a new behavior: you can define a new node extensionally (rather than intensionally) by simply linking to it from many other nodes—even before it has any content.
    - > ...
    - > This effect requires [Contextual backlinks](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3RzQhmjeRxXVAAy81aUSKARwJL8dikdJG4VG): a simple list of backlinks won’t implicitly define a node very effectively. You need to be able to see the context around the backlink to understand what’s being implied.

    - Look at this screenshot. I knew I was looking for something related to "contextual backlinks," so after finding that on google, I was was able to look through the backlinks and find the page that I was looking for: ["Backlinks can be used to implicitly define nodes in knowledge management systems."](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Contextual_backlinks?stackedNotes=z2newCwFfd6iZFyf9bgspkbyt1G8wbQxJVgTK) The backlinks themselves are contextual. They don't just show the page that a phrase is connected to, but also the paragraph that it was linked in.
    - Andy Matuschak's working notes, like a wiki, use hypertext to communicate in an information dense way. This facilitates easy navigation where people are able to find what they are looking for [even when they don't quite know how to express](https://twitter.com/RobertHaisfield/status/1265306759356223493?s=20) it.
    - ![Pasted image 20210913163109](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/Resources/Pasted%20image%2020210913163109.png)
    - Matuschak adds an additional navigation layer to the UX of the wiki- when you click on a link in the page to the left, it opens that up to the right. This gives the effect of a book that rearranges its pages for you based on your present curiosity. One idea I've designed is to expand that out into 2D navigation, where people lay out the tiles, as seen in this working Figma file (https://www.figma.com/file/kHLDEecCMvZAIDnfe95tmp/graph-research-visual-inspo?node-id=0%3A1).
    - The signal/noise ratio is a very big problem when it comes to exploratory search or browsing. The natural inclination is to broaden a search term so people don't have to specifically express what they are looking for. However, in a decentralized discourse graph, you need to deal with the problem of quantity. If you have thousands of pages worth of information in a graph with many contributors, broadening the search will show you too many results.
    - As I mentioned earlier, [C- Search terms express intentions](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/C-%20Search%20terms%20express%20intentions.md). However, not all search results will be relevant to your present intention. [C- People need a way of promoting and demoting knowledge in a decentralized knowledge graph](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/WIP/C-%20People%20need%20a%20way%20of%20promoting%20and%20demoting%20knowledge%20in%20a%20decentralized%20knowledge%20graph.md). In the context of a search, [C- Highlighted and lowlighted search results map to how well results map to intentions](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/C-%20Highlighted%20and%20lowlighted%20search%20results%20map%20to%20how%20well%20results%20map%20to%20intentions.md). Highlighting and lowlighting could come in other forms, such as [quadratic voting](https://twitter.com/metamitya/status/1248768114768084994?s=20), utilized in [Knovigator](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/Tools%20for%20Thought%20Examples/Knovigator.md).
    - [C- People are lazy](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/C-%20People%20are%20lazy.md). This is one of the key barriers to creating a semantic web, so user work that could add meaningful metadata should not be wasted. In asking [Q- What is the data structure of a graph built to facilitate decentralized knowledge synthesis](../LitReview/Main/Q-%20What%20is%20the%20data%20structure%20of%20a%20graph%20built%20to%20facilitate%20decentralized%20knowledge%20synthesis.md), we should note that if the data structure is able to take into account searches, search results, and quality signals, then the result discourse graph structure is fairly semantic. Perhaps the information from these searches could inform the ranking of items in future searches, and what is considered related content. This can itself be seen as a form of incremental formalization.
    - It's important to ask [Q- What changes in a discourse graph as quantity of content increases](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/Q-%20What%20changes%20in%20a%20discourse%20graph%20as%20quantity%20of%20content%20increases.md): for example, it is common for Roam's new users to excitedly claim: "Roam's organization gets better as you write more!" However, [reverse entropy requires specific patterns of user behavior](https://twitter.com/RobertHaisfield/status/1259504520830136320) and is not a given. By using outlines as a data entry interface for their knowledge graph, they encourage patterns of divergent creativity. At its worse, this can lead you with so much information that it feels impossible to bring it all together.
    - People need an interface for convergence as well. [P- Joel Chan](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/People/P-%20Joel%20Chan.md) writes about this as [incremental formalization](https://roambrain.com/knowledge-synthesis/). [Incrementally processing notes is a key user behavior to promote synthesis](../LitReview/Main/C-%20Incrementally%20processing%20notes%20is%20a%20key%20user%20behavior%20to%20promote%20synthesis.md). In doing so, they progressively compress large amounts of information into smaller amounts, which allows people to more easily compose ideas and define their relationships. Writing in hypertext allows people to have an incredible amount of information density. As Andy Matuschak [likes to say](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_note_titles_are_like_APIs):
    - > When [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C) are factored and titled well, those titles become an abstraction for the note itself. The entire note’s ideas can then be referenced using that handle (see [Concept handles, after Alexander](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5vA4vw86DKNq22xt6pRWhumeRmSzwV6hxRHE)). In fact, this property itself functions as a kind of litmus: as you develops ideas in notes over time and improve the “APIs,” you’ll be able to write individual notes which abstract over increasingly large subtrees (e.g. [Enacted experiences have incredible potential as a mass medium](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6oXuXLZ7Wq1eBqskyfph2wz9gjohQUKSBFzx), [Evergreen note-writing as fundamental unit of knowledge work](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3SjnvsB5aR2ddsycyXofbYR7fCxo7RmKW2be)). ^ee42bf
    - When you have read much of a person's work in a well structured hypertext notebook, you can build a rich mental model of their thinking. I've read so much by [P- Tom Critchlow](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/People/P-%20Tom%20Critchlow.md) that, when I read a 6 tweet long twitter thread, I am able to connect it to his [bigger worldview](https://twitter.com/RobertHaisfield/status/1418236841275183111) and even simulate conversations with him. This is because hypertext writing is information dense and refers to sets of ideas in consistent ways. Given that our goal is to combine knowledge at a large scale, information density is crucial.
    - We have also seen summarization as a way to compress information. [Wikum](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/Tools%20for%20Thought%20Examples/Wikum.md) [allows]((http://wikum.csail.mit.edu/)) its users to summarize groups of comments in a Hacker News or Reddit like forum. Summaries can be built on other summaries, allowing people to zoom out and see what a discussion was about at a high level before going into the weeds to read each comment. This demonstrates the need for a [Zoomable User Interface](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/Terms/ZUI.md). *See [C- An ideal decentralized discourse graph would enable people to view information at different levels of granularity through a ZUI](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/WIP/C-%20An%20ideal%20decentralized%20discourse%20graph%20would%20enable%20people%20to%20view%20information%20at%20different%20levels%20of%20granularity%20through%20a%20ZUI.md)*

        - Backlinks & Related Items: *Search as a handle* [I- Populate the related items section through a search term](I-%20Populate%20the%20related%20items%20section%20through%20a%20search%20term.md)
            - The backlinks for `[page title](page%20title)` can be thought of as a the search results for `"[page title](page%20title)"` and are simply [a smart default for what is relevant to a page](C-%20Linked%20references%20are%20a%20smart%20default%20for%20related%20items.md). If, instead of backlinks, we had a more general "Related items" section, then you could modify the search terms for a more expressive definition of what is relevant to the page. [*](Backlinks can be thought of as a the search results for `"[page title](page%20title)"` and are simply [a smart default for what is relevant to a page](C-%20Backlinks%20are%20a%20smart%20default%20for%20what%20is%20related%20to%20an%20idea). One could modify the search terms for a more expressive definition of what is relevant to the page.)
            - For example, a page titled `[Behavioral science theories](Behavioral%20science%20theories)` could have a "related items" section defined by a search for `[Behavioral science theories](Behavioral%20science%20theories)` or any time any specific theory (e.g. `[Perceptual Control Theory](Perceptual%20Control%20Theory)` or `[Self-Determination Theory](Self-Determination%20Theory)`) is mentioned. [*](For example, a page titled `[Behavioral science theories](Behavioral%20science%20theories)` could have "relevant info" section defined by a search for `[Behavioral science theories](Behavioral%20science%20theories)` or any time any specific theory (e.g. `[Perceptual Control Theory](Perceptual%20Control%20Theory)` or `[Self-Determination Theory](Self-Determination%20Theory)`) is mentioned.)

            - These searches could then be composable, enabling more efficient categorization. For example, I might have a page titled `[Theories](Theories)` with an "associated items" section defined by the "associated items" sections for `[Behavioral science theories](Behavioral%20science%20theories)` and `[Biology theories](Biology%20theories)`.

Through logical operators like AND, OR, NOT, IF, and custom relational rules people are able to express precisely what they consider relevant and in which contexts.

            - Contextual dashboards
                - With outlines, you can easily specify what is related and unrelated from each other. This enables you to query chains of thought, instead of individual thoughts. With relational databases, you can create contextual dashboards like Marie Poulin does in Notion. For example, these could be used to create a queue of reading materials related to a subject. Several of our interviewees showed log notes or indices of the areas they were investigating. This reduces cognitive overhead, knowing that you can go to an area and see exactly the information that's relevant at that point
