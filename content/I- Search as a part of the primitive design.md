This page serves as an index page for a clump of ideas.

-   [[I- Replace the backlinks section of a page with a related items section]]. This one gets at the core idea, which is that if backlinks can be expressed as a query, we might as well allow the user to edit those queries, as [[C- Search terms express intentions]]. 
-   [[I- Use search terms as the basis for other features]]
    -   [[I- Utilize search terms as the basis for user-defined notifications]]
    -   [[I- Utilize search terms as the basis for user-defined subscriptions]]
