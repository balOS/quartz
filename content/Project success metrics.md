-   Success:
    -   Research paper
    -   Increased knowledge


- What the project looks like:
    - reading papers [desk research](app://obsidian.md/desk%20research)
    - [participant observation](app://obsidian.md/participant%20observation) by working with social knowledge management communities
    - [user interview](app://obsidian.md/user%20interview)s
    - Synthesis and public hypertext wiki


- Problem being solved:
    - People need an interface to input information into the knowledge graph such that it is [GraphQL](app://obsidian.md/GraphQL) queryable
    - People need to be able to develop their thoughts personally and collectively, at different scales
    - The right balance between unstructured and structured knowledge must be discovered
