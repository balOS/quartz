A sufficiently detailed search term can be the basis for other features. For example:
    - [[I- Utilize search terms as the basis for user-defined subscriptions]]
    - [[I- Utilize search terms as the basis for user-defined notifications]]
    - [[I- Utilize search terms as the basis for conditional formatting]]
