During our interviews, we saw people explicitly structure their thoughts in a variety of ways.</p><p>At times, the structure in place was seemingly everywhere. People showed digital notebooks with a variety of page and block names describing projects and ideas (naming), inline wikilinks to other pages (linking), YAML metadata on each note (attributes), indenting in an outline (explicit relationships), color-coordinated highlights (attributes), detailed file/folder structures (explicit relationships), and block references (explicit relationships).</p><p>In other tools, namely spatial canvases like Figma, Miro, or Kosmik, structure was apparent implicitly. A lasso drawn around a group of items signified they were to be considered together. A word in larger font above a list of items with smaller size shows significance in a grouped form. A line drawn between two items on the canvas connected the ideas. This implicit structure was based on layout, type, and references to other items.</p><p>Yet, in the end, we were surprised to find that people simply don’t structure their work consistently. We can think of this &ldquo;lack of structure&rdquo; as something that lacks formal machine, or even obvious human-readable, classification. A few examples of this appeared as “half-baked ideas,” fuzzy representations in their head or in conversation with others, quick capture notes, informal sketches, or margin notes and highlights.</p><p>Given the choice between structuring now vs. later, people frequently err on the side of having too little structure and rarely, if ever, add structure in hindsight. We found that this often leaves them without useful artifacts they can build on with others (or their future selves).</p><a href=#this-decision-of-how-when-and-what-to-structure-is-a-core-problem-of-current-thought-processors><h2 id=this-decision-of-how-when-and-what-to-structure-is-a-core-problem-of-current-thought-processors><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>This decision of how, when, and what to structure is a core problem of current thought processors</h2></a><a href=#c--specifying-context-for-future-reuse-is-costly><h3 id=c--specifying-context-for-future-reuse-is-costly><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span><a href=/C-Specifying-context-for-future-reuse-is-costly rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/C-Specifying-context-for-future-reuse-is-costly>Specifying context for future reuse is costly</a></h3></a><p><a href=/C-Context-is-necessary-for-knowledge-reuse rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/C-Context-is-necessary-for-knowledge-reuse>Context is necessary for knowledge reuse</a>, but <a href=/C-Specifying-context-for-future-reuse-requires-predicting-trajectories-of-future-reuse rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/C-Specifying-context-for-future-reuse-requires-predicting-trajectories-of-future-reuse>Specifying context for future reuse requires predicting trajectories of future reuse</a> and <a href=/C-Predicting-trajectories-of-future-reuse-of-information-objects-is-hard rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/C-Predicting-trajectories-of-future-reuse-of-information-objects-is-hard>Predicting trajectories of future reuse of information objects is hard</a>.</p><p>As seen in <a href=/R-Formality-Considered-Harmful rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/R-Formality-Considered-Harmful>Formality Considered Harmful</a>, four problems arise from formalizing too early in the process.</p><ul><li>Cognitive overhead - <a href=/If-Im-thinking-too-hard-about-structure-before-I-write-the-note-I-forget-what-I-was-going-to-write-down rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/If-Im-thinking-too-hard-about-structure-before-I-write-the-note-I-forget-what-I-was-going-to-write-down>If I’m thinking too hard about structure before I write the note, I forget what I was going to write down</a>, because often the task of formalism is extraneous to the primary task.</li><li>Tacit knowledge - <a href=/It-takes-too-much-work-to-create-structure rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/It-takes-too-much-work-to-create-structure>It takes too much work to create structure</a> and <a href=/My-tooling-gets-in-the-way-of-working-at-the-speed-of-thought rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/My-tooling-gets-in-the-way-of-working-at-the-speed-of-thought>My tooling gets in the way of working at the speed of thought</a></li><li>Premature structure - <a href=/C-It-is-difficult-to-predict-whether-structure-now-will-be-worthwhile-later rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/C-It-is-difficult-to-predict-whether-structure-now-will-be-worthwhile-later>It is difficult to predict whether structure now will be worthwhile later</a>. Further, It&rsquo;s hard to know what formalism is actually useful for their task up front. A formalism that excludes speculation, for example, or rough scraps that we don&rsquo;t know what to do with yet, will prematurely kill the creative process.

Reduce the cost of structuring</h3></a><p>People tend to prefer just-in-time structuring because specifying context for future reuse is costly, difficult, and has unpredictable benefits. Enabling low-cost structure at the time of writing can help.</p><p>We should be careful as too much structure can inhibit the user&rsquo;s ability to maintain a system. <a href=/C-An-increasing-amount-of-structure-leads-to-entropy rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/C-An-increasing-amount-of-structure-leads-to-entropy>An increasing amount of structure leads to entropy</a>, so ideally the system is able to infer a lot of structure from minimal inputs.</p><p>Natural language processing can also reduce the user&rsquo;s burden, inferring relationships directly from the user&rsquo;s writing without requiring any special formatting. <a href=/Jump rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Jump>Jump</a> is an attempt at this approach. We should note that relying too heavily on a computer&rsquo;s interpretation of natural language may lose some meaning in translation, so it is important to have an <a class="internal-link broken" data-src="/intermediate interface">intermediate interface</a> that both the user and the computer understand. Jump does that, but also will ask the user to confirm or reject its inferences.</p><p>We might also gather metadata from the structure of a workspace. If we use <a href=/I-Workspaces-as-a-primitive rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/I-Workspaces-as-a-primitive>Workspaces as a primitive</a>, then we might infer that items within the same workspace are related to each other.</p><p><a href=/C-Synthesis-tools-need-to-support-incremental-formalization rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/C-Synthesis-tools-need-to-support-incremental-formalization>Synthesis tools need to support incremental formalization</a> as an additional measure - one example of support might be automatically placing notes on a spaced repetition schedule for review, ensuring that if you don&rsquo;t add all of the structure required at the time of writing, it will resurface at some point for you to add structure later.</p><a href=#2-increase-the-benefits-of-structuring><h3 id=2-increase-the-benefits-of-structuring><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>2.

However, <a href=/People-dont-intentionally-review-old-notes rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/People-dont-intentionally-review-old-notes>People don’t intentionally review old notes</a>. Therefore, a promising direction could be to show associated items as you are writing. This is fleshed out in <a href=/C-Designing-for-ambient-review-is-a-rich-opportunity-space rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/C-Designing-for-ambient-review-is-a-rich-opportunity-space>Designing for ambient review is a rich opportunity space</a>.</p><a href=#3-enable-structure-in-hindsight><h3 id=3-enable-structure-in-hindsight><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>3. Enable structure in hindsight</h3></a><p><a href=/I-User-created-consistent-rules-as-a-primitive rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/I-User-created-consistent-rules-as-a-primitive>User created rules</a> can dramatically reduce the amount of work a user needs to put in their structure, allowing users to apply the same structure to all notes past or future that match a certain pattern. Generally, we propose that be done through <a href=/I-Search-as-a-primitive rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/I-Search-as-a-primitive>Search as a primitive</a>. For example, create a dynamic list of all notes with a question mark in the title, then apply a question tag. In Tana, <a class=external-link target=_blank href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPxYt1RNB7E" rel=noopener>&ldquo;supertags&rdquo; are tags that come with a dynamic template</a>. So if you have a list of nodes tagged with person, and you added a field for where they work, it would add that to every node with the person supertag. While this form of <a href=/structure-in-hindsight rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/structure-in-hindsight>structure in hindsight</a> is not implemented through search as a primitive, it could be.</p><p>The user might also create rules such as &ldquo;if X is indented underneath Y, then the two are related.&rdquo; In <a href=/P-Joel-Chan rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/P-Joel-Chan>Joel Chan</a>&rsquo;s <a href=/Discourse-Graph-Plugin rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Discourse-Graph-Plugin>Discourse Graph Plugin</a>, one can even specify relationships such as &ldquo;Any evidence note indented underneath a claim note informs the claim,&rdquo; allowing him to query for claims informed by a piece of evidence. In Obsidian, X is related to Y if they are on the same page. We propose that the user should be able to declare rules about how their style of writing is translated into a data structure.</p><p>Schema migrations (when the user has a consistent schema for a type of thing, but then they change the schema) are also of crucial importance. Inspiration can be drawn here from object-oriented programming, statically typed programming, and <a href=/Cambria rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Cambria>Cambria</a>.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/ data-ctx="Q- How might we navigate the structure now or later tradeoffs" data-src=/ class=internal-link>🪴 Read Me</a><p class=linkTag data-tag></p></li><li><a href=/Adding-structure-later-feels-like-a-chore/ data-ctx="structure now vs. later" data-src=/Adding-structure-later-feels-like-a-chore class=internal-link>Adding structure later feels like a chore</a><p class=linkTag data-tag></p></li><li><a href=/I-Populate-the-related-items-section-through-a-search-term/ data-ctx="structure now vs. later" data-src=/I-Populate-the-related-items-section-through-a-search-term class=internal-link>Populate the related items section through a search term</a><p class=linkTag data-tag=#idea>#idea</p></li><li><a href=/I-Replace-the-backlinks-section-of-a-page-with-a-related-items-section/ data-ctx="Q- How might we navigate the structure now or later tradeoffs" data-src=/I-Replace-the-backlinks-section-of-a-page-with-a-related-items-section class=internal-link>Replace the backlinks section of a page with a related items section</a><p class=linkTag data-tag=#idea>#idea</p></li><li><a href=/Q-What-workflows-and-behaviors-facilitate-synthesis/ data-ctx="the structure now vs. later tradeoff" data-src=/Q-What-workflows-and-behaviors-facilitate-synthesis class=internal-link>What workflows and behaviors facilitate synthesis?</a><p class=linkTag data-tag=#question>#question</p></li></ul></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Rob Haisfield, Joel Chan, Brendan Langen using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/RobertHaisfield>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/classicrob/quartz>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div><script defer src=https://cdn.commento.io/js/commento.js></script><div id=commento></div></div></body></html>
