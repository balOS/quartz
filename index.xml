The Opportunity
Human knowledge is an ever-expanding resource. Unfortunately, more knowledge does not necessarily lead to more understanding. Our methods for sharing knowledge are collapsing under the weight of distrust of science and journalism, false beliefs, misinformation campaigns, and deliberate fraud —not to mention the sheer quantity of information.</description></item><item><title>R- A Troubleshooters Checklist for Prospective Authors</title><link>https://scalingsynthesis.com/R-A-Troubleshooters-Checklist-for-Prospective-Authors/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scalingsynthesis.com/R-A-Troubleshooters-Checklist-for-Prospective-Authors/</guid><description>#references Title: A Troubleshooter&amp;rsquo;s Checklist for Prospective Authors Derived from Reviewers&amp;rsquo; Critical Feedback Meta: Tags: #ref/Paper Authored by:: Adrienne Alton-Lee Year: [[1998]] Publication: Teaching and Teacher Education URL: Citekey: alton-leeTroubleshooterChecklistProspective1998 Content Placeholder Abstract Presents, in order of frequency of occurrence, critical comments apparent in multiple reviews of 58 manuscripts received from April 1997 to April 1998 by Teaching and Teacher Education, thus identifying the breaches of canon most frequently identified in reviewers&amp;rsquo; critical comments.</description></item><item><title>R- Accelerating Scientific Discovery by Lowering Barriers to User-Generated Synthesis of Scientific Literature</title><link>https://scalingsynthesis.com/R-Accelerating-Scientific-Discovery-by-Lowering-Barriers-to-User-Generated-Synthesis-of-Scientific-Literature/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scalingsynthesis.com/R-Accelerating-Scientific-Discovery-by-Lowering-Barriers-to-User-Generated-Synthesis-of-Scientific-Literature/</guid><description>Authored By:: [[P- Joel Chan]] https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yjTjcIVqttXEA2NXKQ75D8iHGTOxiEj4/view

#canonical paper in lab #[📝 lit-notes] Four problems with / created by formalization: 1) cognitive overhead, 2) tacit knowledge, 3) premature structure, and 4) situational structure Cognitive overhead (aka Cognitive Load): often the task of specifying formalism is extraneous to the primary task, or is just plain annoying to do Tacit knowledge: if relevant info for developing formalism is tacit, asking people to formalize it will interrupt the task, with serious consequences for the quality of the work Enforcing Premature Structure: people don&amp;rsquo;t want to commit until they&amp;rsquo;re sure what formalism is actually useful for their task (and what&amp;rsquo;s extraneous and only annoying) Situational Structure: Useful structures and formalisms vary significantly
