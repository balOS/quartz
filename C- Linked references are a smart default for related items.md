- Assuming you're not using aliases, a plain text search in [[../LitReview/Extended Universe/Tools for Thought Examples/Obsidian.md|Obsidian]] for `"[[page]]"` within quotations is functionally indistinguishable from the backlinks for that page. Linked references can then be thought of as a search for related items, where all the app knows is that backlinks have a high likelihood of being related because the user explicitly linked the items together.
- Unlinked references can be thought of as a search for `"page" -"[[page]]`. These have a lower likelihood of relatedness, as the connections were not explicitly made by the author while writing, but may represent latent connections in imported text or [[quick capture]] thoughts. Linking unlinked references is tool for [[../LitReview/structure in hindsight.md|structure in hindsight]]
- If we [[page|[I- Populate the related items section through a search term]]` should be the default term. That will often be enough. However, if it isn't, the user should be able to adjust the search term to more accurately express what they consider to be related.
- [[../LitReview/Extended Universe/People/P- Gordon Brander.md|P- Gordon Brander]] made a similar point, taking inspiration from [[../LitReview/Extended Universe/Tools for Thought Examples/Notational Velocity.md|Notational Velocity]]. As he phrases it in [Search reveals useful dimensions in latent idea space](https://subconscious.substack.com/p/search-reveals-useful-dimensions):
- > **Any sufficiently advanced search is indistinguishable from a hyperlink**. A search query is kind of like a hyperlink that can be constructed on the fly. Our question forges a link between notes, just-in-time. When a search becomes extremely specific, it functions like a coordinate to a specific point in latent idea space.
