Please leave comments to further the discussion and help direct its evolution.\n\n**All you need to do is click on what is interesting.** This is a special trait of this website - hypertext notebooks are designed for exploratory browsing. In a linear piece of writing, all ideas would be sequenced into one narrative. In hypertext writing, the narrative is emergent and the ideas are associative. It is like a book where the pages rearrange themselves for you based on your current curiosity each time you revisit. _For more on what this is, see [[Q- What is a hypertext notebook]]?_\n\nThe goal of this research project is to find data structures and interfaces that support synthesis and innovation in a decentralized discourse graph.\n\nSome suggested starting points:\n\n- To jump straight into the ideas:\n  - [[I- Search as a primitive]]\n  - [[I- A DSL for a discourse graph with information entry, visualization, and retrieval]]\n  - [[Q- How might we navigate the structure now or later tradeoffs]]\n- For broader context about what we are doing and why:\n  - [[Q- What is a decentralized discourse graph]]\n  - [[C- Discourse graphs could significantly accelerate human synthesis work]]\n  - [[C- Synthesis is hard to do with people who don‚Äôt share context with you]]\n  - [[Research Grant Application]]\n\nSome specific how-tos:\n\n- Pages have prefixes in their page titles that indicate what type of node it is:\n  - \"C- \" Claim\n  - \"Q- \" Question\n  - \"R- \" Resource\n  - \"I- \" Idea\n- Builders: View this as a framework for navigating the [idea maze](https://cdixon.org/2013/08/04/the-idea-maze), and form your own conclusions about the claims, questions, and trails between them.\n- Hover your mouse over a link to see a preview of its content\n- If a page is empty, look through its backlinks!

For more details on that, see [[Q- Why do people prefer to structure later or not at all]]. \n\nAdding structure later is a viable alternative, as people likely have a better idea of how their current idea fits into the wider whole. But, we frequently heard that the act of adding structure later **feels like a chore**. \n\nThis showed up when people described processing reading notes, refining old ideas, or managing their queue of work. The idea of a queue of work showed up in many interviews, in a variety of forms.  People would create indexes, pages of TODOs, resource lists, pipelines, areas to review flashcards, or tagged items to return to later. \n\nIdeas were even processed through a queue in certain notebooks, with different stages of an idea categorized (fleeting, literature note, evergreen, etc.) or labeled in a pipeline (premise, develop, completed, etc.).  Some queues were managed specifically, with a spaced repetition algorithm prompting them to return to a prior block.  Others were less formally organized, and people returned to them as a regular, unscheduled part of their work.\n\nA common failure mode for queues was to process the same list multiple times.  For example, someone might look through an inbox of ideas, find the best ones, and then move those over into another list. Then, a month later, they would look through the inbox again, repeating the process.  The problem is that it was difficult to distinguish which ideas they had already processed, so they would repeat the work of screening through ideas they had already screened out. We can see systems like [Allen Wilson's](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/playing-zettelkasten-rpg-through-arbitrary-constraints/) evolve to prevent this repeat work.\n\nOne interviewee went as far as mentioning avoiding the tasks they created to review old notes. Others mentioned reviewing notes felt like repeat effort. \n\nWhile queue processing can be extremely effective to those who have internalized the practice, it was done by very few of our interviewees.\n\nFor more, see: [[C- Current tools do not support flexible exploration and refactoring of structures as they inevitably evolve]]. \n\ntl;dr summary\n\t- Existing structural systems are often seen by people as a chore. Existing queue management systems are too tedious. The story is clear ‚Äì most people don't want to spend time refactoring notes. That feels like [[wasted repeated effort]].\n\t- People may decide not to regularly return to past ideas, which will enable them to stay in flow of their current work. Provided the note can stand on its own, or they don‚Äôt need to add on, this quick capture ‚Äúset it and forget it‚Äù can be fine. \n\t- Problems arise when we want to reuse these old ideas. Inevitably the noise in our notebooks is too loud to find the signal we‚Äôre looking for. Creating queues of work to return to later feels like a chore, and our tools don‚Äôt help us resolve this.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:05.912606142Z","tags":null},"/Agenda":{"title":"Agenda","content":"\nAuthored by:: [[P- Brendan Langen]]\n\nPlayful time-based note-taking system from [[P- Alexander Griekspoor]], built with a series of sample templates to prompt users into creating .\n\nAn interesting aspect of Agenda is an embedded community forum within the app that enables users to discuss workflows, build on, etc. +\n\n![[Pasted image 20211001101109.png]]\n\n![[Pasted image 20211001101437.png]]\n\nDiscussed in the Metamuse podcast with [[P- Adam Wiggins]] and [[P- Mark McGranahan]].","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:05.912606142Z","tags":null},"/Agora":{"title":"Agora","content":"\nAuthored by:: [[P- Brendan Langen]]\n\nAgora is a wiki-like distributed knowledge graph blended with a social network.

If something is no longer important, its presence in your memory is a burden, turning your \"search results\" into a noisy mess that decreases your likelihood of finding the right answer.\n\nMany people use personal knowledge management software to augment their memories. \"Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them\" as stated in the infamous productivity text \"Getting Things Done.\" We saw this again and again in our interviews. Expert synthesizers use thought processors to ensure good ideas don't fall through the cracks. Personally, I use thought processors in conjunction with personal knowledge management in order to ensure the lessons I learn today retain their usefulness in 10 years. If at that point my questions and ideas are dependent on recent memory rather than a decade of learning, I've failed.\n\n[[C- People process complex information in multiple levels and stages of processing]]. Over the course of 1 year using Obsidian, I wrote more than a million words. Maybe 30% of that was from educational materials. The rest was \"thinking out loud\" in order to process thoughts. Eventually, many of those thoughts would be processed into an information artifact. Those artifacts became my canonical point of reference.\n\nWhile this multiplicity is generally useful during the process of thinking through an issue, later down the line reviewing it contributes to the feeling of [[wasted repeated effort]]. Early versions of information in the final artifact can likely be forgotten without much consequence.\n\nAdditionally, over the course of a decade, I'll certainly update my beliefs and mental models. If that happens, I'll have to ask myself, \"Is it important to keep a record of my beliefs at that point in time, or is leaving it in my database weighing it down?\"\n\nI don't know how software can automatically archive this information without making users mad at some point or another.

Additionally, they may believe that it's better to have information and not need it than need it and not have it.\n\nWhether or not either of these beliefs turn out to be true, the hoarders will produce a massive amount of information over the course of 10 years. \n\nIf the first belief is false and they never delete or archive information, then this means they will have too much information to search through in 10 years, turning their personal database into a noisy mess with far too much to sift through for efficient reuse. Whether or not the second belief is true, it must be weighed against the immense cost of bloating your knowledge graph.\n\nThey also may believe that it's better to have information and not need it than \n\nThe problem is that over the course of 10 years, I'll generate so much content that many of it will simply appear to be noise.

The basic idea goes something like this:\n\n- People create chunks to organize experience. Knoblich characterizes Chunks as \"patterns that capture recurring constellations of features or components\" (p. 1535)\n- Encountering a novel problem activates some chunks from past experiences. Not all of them will be helpful; and some will be actively unhelpful. And some will need to be decomposed (compression reversed??)\n- Evidence for this comes from experiments where chunk decomposition was impaired, leading to worse performance on solving the problem.\n\n[[@mccaffreyInnovationReliesObscure2012]] has extended this idea to detail how being able to \"break down\" an idea or object and see its component obscure features in a function-free manner is a powerful strategy for breaking fixation by creatively recombining objects to come up with novel solutions.","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:05.912606142Z","tags":null},"/C-Bulk-refactors-are-a-necessary-primitive-to-maintaining-a-decentralized-discourse-graph":{"title":"C- Bulk refactors are a necessary primitive to maintaining a decentralized discourse graph","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:05.912606142Z","tags":null},"/C-Composability-facilitates-synthesis":{"title":"C- Composability facilitates synthesis","content":"The basic intuition here is that because synthesis involves creating a whole from new parts, composability facilitates synthesis.

But what should the \"parts\" look like? What kinds of building blocks would facilitate synthesis?\n\nOne important dimension of conceptual building blocks for synthesis is \"**size.**\"\n\nIntuitively, having building blocks that are too \"large\" or complex would make reassembly into a new whole impractical or impossible. Thus, the most basic requirement for synthesis is having appropriate(ly sized) building blocks to start with.\n\nThere are a few ways to think about size and why it matters for synthesis.\n\n- A simple benefit is just making it easier to find what you're actually looking for! For example, [[@ribaupierreExtractingDiscourseElements2017]] found that scientists who compared an enhanced faceted search engine (with ability to search a large corpus of articles by discourse elements) to a regular keyword search system in terms of efficacy for various targeted search tasks, self-reported a significantly higher signal-to-noise ratio in results with the faceted search system compared to the keyword search system\n- Decomposing ideas into smaller pieces also enables us to **connect ideas in richer and more meaningful ways**. For example, we learn from creativity theory that [[C- Breaking ideas down into component parts facilitates creative reinterpretation]]. This is because synthesis is a creative act, and conceptual combination is-fundamental-to creative knowledge production.\n\nIt is important to distinguish atomicity from compression - in creative thought, it is less about decomposition in the atomic and disconnected sense, and more about flexibly using compression to move between different levels and states of \"granularity\".\n\n- We see this chiefly from the literature on insight problem solving, which informs us that [[C- Breaking ideas down into component parts facilitates creative reinterpretation]].\n- A related idea is that [[C- People process complex information in multiple levels and stages of processing]].\n\nWe might wonder: if we break complex documents down in a [synthesis] [infrastructure], what should the component parts look like? What defines an \"idea\" level, or an appropriately \"small\" building block for scholarly synthesis?\n\n-   One answer to this is that scholarly synthesis is argumentation and scholarly argumentation operates on atomic statements and concepts as fundamental units.\n-   This should be nuanced, though, because restricting ourselves to only linguistic / symbolic representations would probably be a mistake. There are other forms of knowledge, visual and otherwise, that are important \"units\" that can't be reduced to their \"underlying\" linguistic representation.\n    -   See, for example, **prototypes** [[@galeyHowPrototypeArgues2010]], or **strong concepts**[[@hookStrongConceptsIntermediatelevel2012]]\n    -   Even [[@mccrickardMakingClaimsKnowledge2012]]'s idea of **standard/Claims**\n-   We also may not want to \"reduce\" ideas to a single representation, since [[C- Multiplicity facilitates synthesis]].\n\nUnfortunately, [[C- Most scholarly communication infrastructure operates on the document as the base unit]]\n\n- This is important, because, like insight problem solving, if chunk decomposition is harder, then the task of synthesis gets harder.\n- Scholars encounter a problem with \"chunks\" (papers, sources, etc.), either ones they have already, or ones they seek out.\n- They want to construct a new understanding. To do that, they need to decompose the chunk of the paper/source/chapter, etc. into the component parts they care about, to be able to manipulate them, combine them, move them around, etc. (cf. scholarly argumentation operates on atomic statements and concepts as fundamental units).\n- The source of difficulty for chunk decomposition in this case isn't necessarily the fact that the chunks are \"tight\" in the specific sense that Knoblich meant: that is, the components of the chunk *are* meaningful. It's just that the scholar has to \"chisel\" them out of the paper.

For example, in a case study of calendar systems, [[R- Information and Context|@dourishInformationContextLessons1993]] documented how having metadata for event information such as the title of the event or arrival time of the speaker, in addition to who the author of the information is, were critical for the interpretation of the events. Similarly, [[R- Context Grabbing Assigning Metadata in Large Document Collections|@hinrichsContextGrabbingAssigning2005]] documented how decentralized project documentation made recontextualization difficult for engineers because they didn't know the history of changes for a document or if a particular document was up to date, leading to issues such as \"exploratory digging by hand\" to avoid damaging power lines. Finally, in a field study of collaborative information reuse in aircraft technical support [[R- Beyond Boundary Objects|@luttersBoundaryObjectsCollaborative2007]], engineers lamented reusing old records because information was missing, outdated, or not appropriate anymore because of procedural changes. Over the years if any changes to the records were not tagged, the context of those changes were lost.\n\nCloser to the setting of synthesis that we care about, context can refer to methodological details like who was studied and with what measures, as well as the intellectual history of the authors of a study [[R- Collaborative information synthesis 1]]. Properly contextualizing knowledge claims with these details can mean the difference between loosely or superficially assembling an argument, or an [[Q- What is synthesis | effective synthesis]]","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:05.912606142Z","tags":null},"/C-Contextualizability-is-necessary-for-synthesis":{"title":"C- Contextualizability is necessary for synthesis","content":"\nAuthored By:: \n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:05.912606142Z","tags":null},"/C-Curation-is-an-important-role-in-maintaining-a-decentralized-discourse-graph":{"title":"C- Curation is an important role in maintaining a decentralized discourse graph","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:05.912606142Z","tags":null},"/C-Current-tools-do-not-support-flexible-exploration-and-refactoring-of-structures-as-they-inevitably-evolve":{"title":"C- Current tools do not support flexible exploration and refactoring of structures as they inevitably evolve","content":"\nAuthored By:: [[P- Rob Haisfield]]\n\n\n\nPredefining a system limits our ability to explore alternatives outside the current structure.  This cascades into the decisions to be made while in the act of work ‚Äì what folder to place the note in, what naming conventions to use, what metadata should be added, and on.  \n\nWhen something doesn't feel like it fits into a pre-existing structure, participants would feel stressed out. This happens frequently while exploring a new domain of knowledge, as people don‚Äôt yet know what the most useful schema will be. People also like to change their schemas as their skill with a thought processor increases and they learn more optimal paths.\n\nA simple, practical example: \n\nImagine you have a template for each book you read, but you want to add additional attributes later. Updating your template is nice, but it doesn't highlight what's missing from current files. This creates more work for yourself whenever you want to make an update!\n\nIn note writing tools like Obsidian and Athens, adding this new metadata to instances of the template in hindsight is entirely manual.  [[It's hard to change structure later]]. In a relational database like Notion or Airtable, the process is a little easier: add a new column to the table and filter or apply conditional formatting for empty fields.\n\nOf course, done correctly, this structure can also enable easier reuse of past thoughts and the sharing of ideas with others. As we‚Äôve discussed, structure is not a bad thing! However, the limitations of predefining structure are worth noting. Choosing not to define consistent attributes, or simply using implicit structure in notes, allows for flexibility in our thought process and preserves optionality.  On the downside, this limits our ability for rich querying and flexibility of ‚Äúviews‚Äù down the road. Then we have to rely on our calcified memory of attributes to refactor our work. \n\nIf we want structure in our notes, our current tools require that we explicitly add it, in the form of names, placement or attributes. Certain sorts of structure are more rigid than others. For example, open ended metadata enabled email to be expanded into new use cases.\n    - \u003e¬†You can add any headers you like. This makes the set of headers an open set, enabling new use-cases to evolve from the bottom-up. Want to record the title, author, and publish date of your books? Add some headers. Want to include a location? Add a header.¬†\n\n    [[P- Gordon Brander]] [If headers did not exist, it would be necessary to invent them](https://subconscious.substack.com/p/if-headers-did-not-exist-it-would)\n\nAlso, whether there are multiple paths to the data is important.  For example, someone using Roam might be more comfortable throwing many types of structure at the wall because they know if one system fails to resurface a note¬†they likely have a fallback. In a file / folder system like Evernote, the folder location of a note matters much more because search is your only fallback if you don't remember which folder a note was in. For example, someone using Roam might be more comfortable throwing things at the wall because they know if one system fails to resurface something¬†they might have a fallback\n\nFor more details on how to enable restructuring in hindsight, see [[I- Search as a primitive]] and [[Agora]], as well as the question [[Q- How might we allow people to adapt their past system and notes to current needs]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:05.912606142Z","tags":null},"/C-Designing-for-ambient-review-is-a-rich-opportunity-space":{"title":"C- Designing for ambient review is a rich opportunity space","content":"If [[People don‚Äôt intentionally review old notes]] but still want old notes to resurface, we might ask how to display that information in an ambient manner, in contrast to traditional approaches that require individuals to explicitly choose to review old notes.\n\nAs described in [[C- Reviewing past notes in the process of creating new notes is a key user behavior to promote synthesis]], as you look for a spot to place a new card in a [[Zettelkasten]], you unintentionally pass other notes, sparking new ideas. [[search or create]] and [[autocomplete]] accomplish similar outcomes, leading people to [incrementally process their notes](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/write-hypertext-notebook-graph-research/page/FgDkjHlEG) as they review information they didn't intend to review.\n\nMany apps will augment search with additional suggestions from previously saved data. For example, [[Evernote]] has a web browser extension that displays possibly relevant notes whenever you search Google. [[WorldBrain Memex]] maintains a full text index of all of the web pages you have saved or annotated and does the same.\n\nOn [[Twitter]], the right side of the desktop screen displays trending information. For people who use Twitter as a social knowledge management tool, trending stories is often distracting. [[P- Geoffrey Litt]] created the [[Twemex]] browser extension to replace that with more helpful ambient information. For example, if you are on a profile, it displays either their top tweets or your conversations with the individual. While viewing a tweet, it displays quote tweets, which can be thought of as [[backlinks]].\n\n[[Threadhelper]] is another browser extension that searches your tweet, bookmark, and retweet history while you are writing a tweet to help you compose quote tweet heavy threads. While [[Twemex]] enables you to manually write searches while tweeting, those searches are, by nature, intentional. Since Threadhelper creates constantly updating searches for similar tweets, it is more likely to surprise the author.\n\nHowever, [[C- Linked references are a smart default for related items]]. What if we could have a smarter concept of relatedness? For example, if I'm writing on a page about the intersection of two topics, wouldn't it be more helpful to find other areas where those two topics co-occur? If I'm talking about 5 topics, areas where those 5 topics co-occur?\n\nThe problem is that as you increase the number of topics that need to intersect, you also decrease the total number of results. It's unlikely that you have another page in your notes that reference all 10 of the pages you referenced in the note you are writing right now!\n\nFor this, I propose a slider. This slider would allow you to say: \"show me any pages that mention at least 3/10 of these\n\n-   ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fwrite-hypertext-notebook-graph-research%2FbltwPhVuwk.png?alt=media\u0026token=1e4fbbb3-9659-4fe5-a39e-99c65a967a36)\n\nFor more detail on this idea, see part 3 of this: [https://www.figma.com/file/5shwLdUCHxSaPNEO7pazbe/Dhrumil%26Robert---RoamGames-Challenge-2?node-id=0%3A1](https://www.figma.com/file/5shwLdUCHxSaPNEO7pazbe/Dhrumil%26Robert---RoamGames-Challenge-2?node-id=0%3A1)\n\nA constraint here is that this could be seen as distracting, as sometimes people even complain that options presented by wikilink autocompletion would distract them from the thought they were actually trying to get down. In these instances, the user should be able to toggle it off.\n\nHowever, distraction can be valuable. [[P- Devon Zuegel]] claims that her most important insights came in conversations with others, where they would ask surprising questions that force her to reconsider ideas, rotate them, or examine them through a different lens. Surprise is a key ingredient for synthesis.\n\nSimple UX changes can often be enough to facilitate ambient review. For example, [[P- CatoMinor]] created CSS that would move the linked references for a page in [[Roam Research]] to the right side of the view. When they were at the bottom of the view for a page, this meant that users needed to manually scroll to view linked references, which would take them out of the act of writing. By displaying linked references on the right, [it was easier to review without breaking their flow](https://twitter.com/CatoMinor3/status/1496467417098248192?s=20\u0026t=TaH4nzPwDSSr5t3DW5x9uQ).\n\nIn our interviews, we encountered multiple people who would set up [[Spaced repetition systems]] to resurface their most important notes periodically. Spaced repetition is typically used with flashcards to memorize information, but the people we interviewed had little interest in memorization.\n\nInstead, their goal was to review notes in a context independent way. If they used linked references as a primary method to resurface notes, they would only see entries that were contextually relevant to their current tasks.\n\nMany people incorporate spaced repetition directly into their note taking tools, as can be seen in [[P- Maggie Appleton]]'s [roam tour](https://youtu.be/RXXXHN516qc?t=1601). This enables Maggie to gradually cultivate her evergreen notes without deliberately seeking them out.","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:05.912606142Z","tags":null},"/C-Discourse-graphs-could-significantly-accelerate-human-synthesis-work":{"title":"C- Discourse graphs could significantly accelerate human synthesis work","content":"Authored By:: [[P- Joel Chan]]\n\nAn exciting hypothesis that motivates this work is that making discourse graphs widely available could accelerate human synthesis work, and thereby [[C- Effective synthesis is necessary for innovation and scientific progress|accelerate innovation and scientific discovery]].\n\nTo understand why this information model might augment synthesis, consider a researcher who wants to understand what interventions might be most promising for mitigating online harassment. To synthesize a formulation of this complex interdisciplinary problem that can advance the state of the art, she needs material that can help her work through detailed answers to a range of questions. For example, which theories have the most empirical support in this particular setting? Are there conflicting theoretical predictions that might signal fruitful areas of inquiry? What are the key phenomena to keep in mind when designing an intervention (e.g., perceptions of human vs. automated action, procedural considerations, noise in judgments of wrongdoing, scale considerations for spread of harm)? What intervention patterns (whether technical, behavioral, or institutional) have been proposed that are both a) judged on theoretical and circumstantial grounds as likely to be effective in this setting, and b) lacking in direct evidence for efficacy?\n\nThe answers to these questions cannot be found simply in the titles of research papers, in groupings of papers by area, or even in citation or authorship networks. The answers lie at lower levels of granularity: the level of theoretical and empirical **claims** or statements made within publications. For example, \"viewers in a Twitch chat engaged in less bad behaviors after a user was banned by a moderator for bad behavior\", and \"banning bad actors from a subreddit in 2015 was somewhat effective at mitigating spread of hate speech on other subreddits\" are claims that interrelate in complex ways, both supporting other claims/theories that are in tension with each other. \n\nThis level of granularity is crucial not just for finding relevant claims to inform the synthesis, but also for constructing more complex arguments and theories, by connecting statements in logical and discursive relationships. \n\nBeyond operating at the claim level, our researcher will also need to work through a range of **contextual details**. For example, to judge which studies, findings, or theories are most applicable to her setting, she needs to know key methodological details including the comparability of different studies' interventions, settings, populations, and outcome measures. She might need to reason over the fact that two studies that concluded limited efficacy of bans had ban interventions that were quite short, on a forum with no identity verification. Or she might reason through the fact that a prominent theory of bad faith and discourse was proposed by a philosopher from the early 2000's (before the rise of modern social media). To judge the validity of past findings (e.g., what has been established with sufficient certainty, where the frontier might be), she would need to know, for example, which findings came from which measures (e.g., self-report, behavioral measures), and the extent to which findings have been replicated cross authors from different labs, and across a variety of settings (e.g., year, platform, scale).\n\n### Hypothesized individual benefits: Creative synthesis and exploration\n\nA discourse graph as a data structure has key affordances that are hypothesized to enable just these sorts of synthesis operations. Information is represented primarily at the claim or statement level, and embedded in a graph of relationships with other claims and context. In a discourse graph, claims have many-to-many relationships to support composition of more complex arguments and theories, or \"decompression\" into component supporting/opposing claims. Contextual entities and information, such as methodological details and metadata, are explicitly included in the discourse graph. This supports direct analysis of claims with their evidentiary context, supporting critical engagement, integration, and even reinterpretation of individual findings. The following figure shows how this might be supported in the specific worked example above. Note that discourse graphs need not be represented or manipulated in this visual format; the underlying graph model can be instantiated in a variety of media, such as hypertext notebooks, and also implicitly in various analog implementations that allow for cross-referencing. What is important is the information architecture of representing networks of claims and their context.\n\n![[Fig - Discourse graph example for effects of bans on online antisocial behavior.png]]\n\nBeyond the theoretical match between the kinds of queries scientists need to run over their evidence collection for synthesis, a discourse-centric representation that encodes granular claims instead of document \"buckets\" could facilitate exploration and conceptual combination. There is theoretical precedent for this in research on expertise and creative problem solving, where breaking complex ideas down into more meaningful, smaller conceptual \"chunks\" may be necessary for creative recombination into new conceptual wholes.[^1] Removing contextual details (though not losing the ability to recover them) may also be necessary and useful for synthesizing ideas and reusing knowledge across boundaries.[^2] \n\nAt the same time, constructive and creative engagement with contextual details, is thought to be necessary for developing novel conceptual wholes from \"data\", such as in sensemaking,[^3] systematic reviews,[^4] or formal theory development.[^5] This is a more specific application of the general insight that [[C- Context is necessary for knowledge reuse]]. Further, accurately predicting just which contextual details are necessary to represent directly in an information object is a difficult task[^6] that may be functionally impossible in creative settings.\n\nThe conjunction of these affordances --- having both granular information objects like claims, and the ability to progressively expand their context by traversing/retrieving from the discourse graphs --- may help to resolve this tension between granularity and contextualizability. For instance, graph-model and hypertext affordances like hyperlinking or transclusion might enable scientists to hide \"extraneous details\" (to facilitate compression) without destructively blocking future reusers from obtaining necessary contextual details for reuse.[^6] \n\n### Hypothesized collective benefits: Reduced overhead, and enhanced creative reuse\n\n**Discourse graphs (or parts thereof) could also significantly reduce the overhead to synthesis through reuse and repurposing over time, across projects, and potentially even across people.**[^7] For example, imagine collaborators sharing discourse graphs with each other, rather than simple documents full of unstructured notes, to speed up the process of working towards shared mental models and identifying productive areas of divergence; or a lab  onboarding new researchers not with long reading lists, but with discourse graph subsets they can build on over time. How much effort could be reduced if this were a reality?\n \nThe same affordances of discourse graphs around granularity and contextualizability that are hypothesized to augment individual synthesis should also facilitate exploration and reuse of an evidence collection that was created by someone else, or by oneself in the past. For example, granular representation of scientific ideas at the claim level is a much better theoretical match for the kinds of queries that scientists want to ask of an evidence collection during synthesis.[^8]\n\nThese claims may also be more to the level of processing required to be understood and reused by others, compared to raw annotations and marginalia.[^9] Also, ambiguity around concepts can be a significant barrier to reuse across knowledge boundaries. For example, keyword search is only really useful when there is a stable, shared understanding of ontology:[^10] this condition is almost certainly not present when [[Q- How do we solve the problem of different people referring to the same concept with different language|crossing knowledge boundaries]][^11] and perhaps not even within fields of study with [[R- Epistemology and the socio-cognitive perspective in information science|significant ongoing controversy]] amongst different schools of thought [^12]\n\nIn these settings, judging that two things are \"the same\" is problematic and difficult task; doing so without engagement with context can sometimes introduce *more* destructive ambiguity, not less, a hard-won lesson from the history of Semantic Web,[^13] ontology[^14] and classification efforts.[^15] A discourse-centric graph that embeds concepts in discourse contexts, traversing through networks of contextual details (such as authors, measures, contexts), and perhaps augmented by formal concepts as hooks, may be a better match for exploring ideas across knowledge boundaries. Further, although in many instances of knowledge reuse, contextual details tend to vary substantially across reuse tasks,[^16] there might be sufficient overlap of useful contextual details (e.g., participant information, study context) that remain stable across reuse tasks.[^17] \n\n\n[^1]:  [[R- Achieving Both Creativity and Rationale]], [[R- The minds eye in chess]] [[R- Constraint relaxation and chunk decomposition in insight problem solving]], [[R- Innovation Relies on the Obscure]]\n[^2]: [[R- Institutional Ecology Translations and Boundary Objects]], [[R- Ambiguity and Engagement]]\n[^3]: [[R- The Cost Structure of Sensemaking]]\n[^4]: [[R- Collaborative information synthesis 1]]\n[^5]: [[R- Theoretical musings]], [[R- Theory Before the Test]], [[R- Are theoretical results Results]], [[R- Darwin on man A psychological study of scientific creativity]]\n[^6]: [[R- Organizational Memory as Objects Processes and Trajectories]], [[R- Beyond Boundary Objects]]\n[^7]: [[P- Rob Haisfield|Rob]] comment: In case it was not clear the gravity of what's being communicated here: this is learning through portfolio effects at scale, spread across people.

Consider, for instance, the impact of source control ‚Äî its effect occurs to other individuals in the population, not the individual who implements the intervention by wearing a mask...Even then, ethical issues prevent the availability of an unmasked control arm (27).

Through the [[Jump]] model, you would [[C- Selection is a core primitive for Jump|select through search and manual addition and subtraction]], then apply some refactoring to all of them.\n\nBulk processing is incredibly powerful to address the question of [[Q- How might we allow people to adapt their past system and notes to current needs|adapting user patterns over time]] if we treat [[I- Search as a primitive]].\n\nFor example, [[P- Joel Chan]] developed a [[Discourse Graph Plugin]] that enabled him to follow a structure where different notes had types (claim, question, evidence, source), whereas previously he followed the Zettelkasten method. Because he followed a personal convention of \"Z: \" in the title of all of his claims, he was able to search for all notes that followed the convention to give himself a list to process so that he could update his past notes to his current system. In a system that puts end-user programming first as I suggest, he would be able to take that list and [[Q- How might we apply map filter reduce to notes and what other primitives are relevant to this domain|map a command]] to change the titles.\n\nIn the past, I followed a system where I would tag all of my question pages with `#question` and my claims with `#claim.` As you can see in this notebook, I've changed my strategy to involve prefixing the titles of the notes. This enables me quick access within autocomplete while also reducing the friction to create structure, as this does not require me to even open the page after I've created it. The same principle applies here, where I know how to specify a query that would bring my old notes in that followed a specific convention, and I could process them all in bulk.\n\nThe problem becomes more difficult in situations where the user has no prior convention and wants to add one. For example, now I prefix the page titles for people, and before I did not. This means I have no query that can find all people in my graph. Here is where [[Q- What is the role of AI in facilitating a decentralized discourse graph|AI might help]]. It might be able to perform named entity recognition and find pages that likely represent people. Many users we interviewed had a pattern where they would mark their meeting notes with a link to `[[meeting notes]]`, so perhaps the language model could narrow its searches to pages mentioned within meeting notes pages.\n\nSo as a general claim, this problem can be solved if we can identify a queryable consistent pattern. We often find that, even if it doesn't feel like we have a prior convention, there is something consistent about what we did before. Either the user or the system can identify that consistency.","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:05.912606142Z","tags":null},"/C-End-user-programming-enables-the-developers-to-be-lazy-about-their-backlog-of-feature-requests":{"title":"C- End-user programming enables the developers to be lazy about their backlog of feature requests","content":"This was a claim from [[P- Geoffrey Litt]] on his episode of the Metamuse Podcast.","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:05.912606142Z","tags":null},"/C-End-user-scripting-enables-creative-workarounds":{"title":"C- End-user scripting enables creative workarounds","content":"\nAuthored By:: [[P- Rob Haisfield]]\n\n[User skill level increases over time](https://robhaisfield.com/notes/user-skill-level-increases-over-time), and people with high User Involvement understand your app‚Äôs core mechanisms so well that, when they face a new problem, they are able to come up with creative workarounds by rubber-banding multiple actions together.

This facilitates easy navigation where people are able to find what they are looking for [even when they don't quite know how to express](https://twitter.com/RobertHaisfield/status/1265306759356223493?s=20) it.\n\nPeople need an interface for convergence as well. [[P- Joel Chan]] writes about this as [incremental formalization](https://roambrain.com/knowledge-synthesis/). [[C- Incrementally processing notes is a key user behavior to promote synthesis|Incrementally processing notes is a key user behavior to promote synthesis]]. In doing so, they progressively compress large amounts of information into smaller amounts, which allows people to more easily compose ideas and define their relationships. Writing in hypertext allows people to have an incredible amount of information density. As Andy [likes to say in \"Evergreen Note Titles are like APIs\"](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_note_titles_are_like_APIs): \n\n \u003e When [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C) are factored and titled well, those titles become an abstraction for the note itself. The entire note‚Äôs ideas can then be referenced using that handle (see [Concept handles, after Alexander](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5vA4vw86DKNq22xt6pRWhumeRmSzwV6hxRHE)). In fact, this property itself functions as a kind of litmus: as you develops ideas in notes over time and improve the ‚ÄúAPIs,‚Äù you‚Äôll be able to write individual notes which abstract over increasingly large subtrees (e.g. [Enacted experiences have incredible potential as a mass medium](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6oXuXLZ7Wq1eBqskyfph2wz9gjohQUKSBFzx), [Evergreen note-writing as fundamental unit of knowledge work](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3SjnvsB5aR2ddsycyXofbYR7fCxo7RmKW2be)).\n\nWhen the title of the note is able to substitute for the whole idea, it compresses a large amount of knowledge into a sentence, allowing knowledge workers to create a shorthand supported by autocomplete wikilinks. Through bidirectional linking, those wikilinks also create a collection of relevant material. \n\nHypertext structured in this manner is excellent for exploratory search. When people read a page they do not fully understand, hyperlinks will take them to the pages that explain component concepts, recursively, until they have learned what they need to know to grasp the original page. This style of search is efficient, because if people already understand a concept, they do not need to pursue the links further.\n\nWhen you have read much of a person's work in a well structured hypertext notebook, you can build a rich mental model of their thinking. I've read so much by [[P- Tom Critchlow]] that, when I read a 6 tweet long twitter thread, I am able to connect it to his [bigger worldview](https://twitter.com/RobertHaisfield/status/1418236841275183111) and even simulate conversations with him. This is because hypertext writing is information dense and refers to sets of ideas in consistent ways. Given that our goal is to combine knowledge at a large scale, information density is crucial.\n\nIf a key challenge of decentralized synthesis is bringing people up to speed, then hypertext is a promising direction.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:05.912606142Z","tags":null},"/C-Incremental-formalization-can-mitigate-risks-of-formalism-in-interactive-systems":{"title":"C- Incremental formalization can mitigate risks of formalism in interactive systems","content":"- #[[üå≤ zettels]]\n    - Tags:  #[[D/Synthesis Infrastructure]] #[[incremental formalization]] #compositionality\n    - Description:\n        - The basic intuition is described well by [[R- Formality Considered Harmful|@shipmanFormalityConsideredHarmful1999]]: user enter information in a mostly informal fashion, and then formalize only later in the task when appropriate formalisms become clear and also (more) immediately useful. \n            - Basic idea: (mostly) informal entry of information, then defer formalization until later in the task when it is useful\n        - Here I note a few examples from [[R- Formality Considered Harmful|@shipmanFormalityConsideredHarmful1999]] to help flesh out the concept (these are all older systems, mostly research systems, so unfortunately they're not available to play with):\n            1.

It also helps with the premature and situational structure problems, since you don't have to commit early on to a structure that may not serve you well (or even hurt your performance) later on.\n    - [[C- Gracefully integrating formalism into interactive systems is hard]].

Knowledge evolves over time, and we adapt our thoughts as we see other perspectives. This is the [sensemaking](sensemaking.md) process. This is our introduction to something new, and we know the least we ever will about the topic at this time. \n\nSimilarly, in the moment a note is created, it is very difficult to know where it __belongs__. We may not yet have a name for what we're seeing or know how it relates to another insight. Our understanding will likely evolve after reading other sources. On later review, we may even find a unique detail of the wider point to be the most interesting. It's hard to know everything up front! \n\n[[C- Sensemaking requires iterative loops of (re)interpreting data in light of evolving schemas]]. The primary models that represent this process are the [Learning Loop Complex](Learning%20Loop%20Complex.md) and the [Notional Model of Sensemaking](Notional%20Model%20of%20Sensemaking.md), which loops between and within foraging and sensemaking loops, progressively increasing in structure and effort, starting from raw data sources and culminating in a synthesized set of hypotheses. \n\nIn our interviews, we saw multiple people talk about their process of [[conversations, chats with others]] to crystallize new information, like [R16](R16) in their synthesis process. Sometimes this can be a frame, or a prompt, that the person presented to themselves, like [R10](R10) writing multiple versions in order to speak fluently about the topic. \n\nThis all speaks to the need to treat notes as a work in progress. Notes aren't in their final form when first written; they evolve, often far beyond the stub they began as. Translating to tool design, [[C- There needs to be an excellent workflow for refactoring in a tool for thought]] to enable [[incremental formalization]].\n\nIn the scope of a [[Thought processor]], we see different approaches. [[Roam Research]] encourages users to write directly into a daily notes page, linking to pages as they write. This contrasted conventional practice in tools like Evernote that ask the user to name the page and place it in a folder up front. Zettelkasten systems, which are agnostic to a specific tool, ask users to create a note without names and later fit it in next to similar notes.\n\nIn the process of synthesis, we often write a number of notes about an idea - some useful, some not. We know that [[C- Multiplicity facilitates synthesis]], and this writing process helps, but it creates a huge amount of noise for us to later search through. We have a need for [[Archiving]].\n\nForgetting is powerful. If something is no longer important, its presence in your memory is a burden, turning your \"search results\" into a noisy mess that decreases your likelihood of finding the right answer.\n\nMany people use personal knowledge management software to augment their memories. \"Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them\" as stated in the infamous productivity text \"Getting Things Done.\" We saw this again and again in our interviews. Expert synthesizers use thought processors to ensure good ideas don't fall through the cracks. Personally, I use thought processors in conjunction with personal knowledge management in order to ensure the lessons I learn today retain their usefulness in 10 years. If at that point my questions and ideas are dependent on recent memory rather than a decade of learning, I've failed.\n\nHowever, over the course of 1 year using Obsidian, I wrote more than a million words. Maybe 30% of that was from educational materials. The rest was \"thinking out loud\" in order to process thoughts. Eventually, many of those thoughts would be processed into an information artifact. Those artifacts became my canonical point of reference.\n\nWhile this multiplicity is generally useful during the process of thinking through an issue, later down the line reviewing it contributes to the feeling of [[wasted repeated effort]]. Early versions of information in the final artifact can likely be forgotten without much negative consequence. \n\nAdditionally, over the course of a decade, I'll certainly update my beliefs and mental models. If that happens, I'll have to ask myself, \"Is it important to keep a record of my beliefs at that point in time, or is leaving it in my database weighing it down?\"\n\nI don't know how software can automatically archive this information without making users mad at some point or another. This is a hard problem, but it should be clear that [[C- Bulk refactors are a necessary primitive to maintaining a decentralized discourse graph]].\n\nAt the extreme end, Venkatesh Rao jokingly referred to an archetype of user as [\"mind-palace pack rats\"](https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1370583027512872961). These are the people who don't know how to delete information and want to either memorize or save all information they encounter. I occasionally fall into this trap. [[C- Predicting trajectories of future reuse of information objects is hard]], and information hoarders may believe that everything will be reused at some point. Additionally, they may believe that it's better to have information and not need it than need it and not have it.\n\nWhether or not either of these beliefs turn out to be true, the hoarders will produce a massive amount of information over the course of 10 years. \n\nIf the first belief is false and they never delete or archive information, then this means they will have too much information to search through in 10 years, turning their personal database into a noisy mess with far too much to sift through for efficient reuse. Whether or not the second belief is true, it must be weighed against the immense cost of bloating your knowledge graph.\n\nThe problem is that over the course of 10 years, I'll generate so much content that many of it will simply appear to be noise. Not everything you believe to be important today will be important then. Most likely, you will only want the most important artifacts due to time constraints.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:05.912606142Z","tags":null},"/C-Power-users-want-to-directly-interface-with-the-data-structure-of-the-app":{"title":"C- Power users want to directly interface with the data structure of the app","content":"I've noticed a really interesting trend lately in apps built for power usage... When the user starts out, they have a GUI (Graphical User Interface) that helps them learn how to do things. As [User skill level increases over time](https://robhaisfield.com/notes/user-skill-level-increases-over-time), they can actually disable elements of the GUI, decreasing the clutter on the screen that they no longer need as a memory aid for how to do X or Y.\n\nTake a look at how Figma shows you all of these buttons you can click that would modify your selection. This helps the new user discover what is possible!\n\n![[Pasted image 20220519182935.png]]\n\nEventually, Figma users will learn keyboard shortcuts. At this point, they can press a shortcut (command+period on Mac) that will hide most of the UI. Now they are just interacting directly with Figma's infinite canvas data structure. Advanced users speed up and enter a flow state with total immersion. Manipulating a file feels as intuitive as reaching to grab something. It's just like movement.\n\n![[Pasted image 20220519182947.png]]\n\nI recently saw a post on LinkedIn where someone shared a five page PDF filled with keyboard shortcuts in Excel. Can you imagine how rewarding your mastery would feel if you learned all of them, and were able to interact with just a spreadsheet? No BS that clogs your screen, just rows and columns? You know how the data structure works and how to move... wouldn't those training wheels just feel like clutter?\n\n![[Pasted image 20220519183001.png]]\n\nIn [GuidedTrack](https://robhaisfield.com/notes/GuidedTrack), you start out using the [toolbar](https://robhaisfield.com/notes/guidedtrack-toolbar) and filling out forms that generate code for you based on your inputs. Eventually, you're just writing the code yourself.\n\n![[Pasted image 20220519183029.png]]\n\nWhen you're at the point where you're just writing code instead of using the toolbar, you aren't slowed down by having to click through a bunch of different screens. The user actually gets faster, as they're able to produce code as quickly as they can type. We're using the GUI as training wheels for more efficient workflows, whereas GUI first applications like Tripetto won't get much quicker after you learn how to use it.\n\n\u003ciframe style=\"border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share\u0026url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FdTePTU7khNGg53ho1pbH8S%2FDSL-vs.-GUI-Speed-Comparison%3Fnode-id%3D23%253A0\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n*This is a Figma file, so you can move around it with normal zoom-pan controls (pinch or scroll your mouse to zoom, click-drag to pan)*\n\nI'll need to think about this more, but in general the trend seems to go as following: the GUI provides training wheels to understand the data structure of the application, and power users want to directly interface with the data structure of the app, with as much information density as possible.

In order to give instructions to a GUI app, users need to click on buttons/menu items, click-and-drag blocks, and write in text boxes. GUIs are the dominant interaction design paradigm for non-coders [^2].\n\nWithout code, people need to be comfortable with whatever pre-existing features they can find, and if they want something custom, they will need to hire a coder or use a graphical no-code tool that will ultimately require them to use the same coding concepts.\n\nCoders will open a text file with an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) [^3]. Their IDE will provide helpful features (graphical or textual) to debug, refactor, and generally support writing more functional code. Coders give software instructions by writing in text what they want. Generally, code is flexible enough that they can make it do anything they want.\n\nWhile working on the onboarding for GuidedTrack [^4], I began to think‚Ä¶ What if people could interact with apps like coders interact with their programs? What is the difference between clicking a button to call a function and writing code to call a function? **In the future of text, I foresee programmable text interfaces with custom IDEs replacing graphical applications.**\n\nGuidedTrack [^5] is a simple low-code application that allows you to make surveys, experiments, web applications, online courses, signup forms, and more. While the use cases are broad, here I will primarily focus on the form builder side of it for simplicity. As one of my projects with Spark Wave [^6], GuidedTrack is the best example I know of a textual interface, so I‚Äôll dive into it and extract takeaways as I go.\n\n![[CleanShot 2022-05-20 at 17.24.02.png]]\n\n**The keywords are direct and domain-specific.** If you were to describe a survey in an email that you send to a collaborator, how would you do it? That‚Äôs not going to be far off from how it looks in GuidedTrack. This makes it feel like a **_textual interface_** for an app people are already familiar with. **Users write their instructions with text at the level of abstraction they care about.**\n\nStraightforward and direct language design is crucial. This quote from A Small Matter of Programming [^7] stuck out to me: \"A mathematician, in a broad sense, already knows Mathematica.\" Wolfram Mathematica formally encodes pre-existing mental models / notation into a syntax that can be used for computing.\n\nEach line represents a function (marked by the keyword at the beginning of the line), and relationships are conveyed through indentation. In order to add a caption to an *image, you indent a caption under the *image. In order to ask a follow-up *question, you indent the follow-up underneath specific answers, which are indented under the question. Saving responses to use for later is also done through indentation. **The syntax is simple.**\n\nIn user research, we found that non-coders often believe that in order to write code, they need to spend significant time reading documentation upfront. However, in GuidedTrack we have a toolbar filled with forms that enable you to write code through a graphical interface. All the user needs to do is fill in the blanks, toggle options on or off, and select options from menus. **The toolbar enables users to learn as they go and write code before they know how.** This is more or less equivalent to the graphical interfaces people are used to in Google Forms, but the difference is that once you get used to it you can just type.\n\nFor example, in this image, we see a form for writing a question. This multiselect checkbox type question will save the answers to a variable labeled `participantSubscriptions.` Later, these saved answers can be referenced in a **conditional** (e.g. \"if Netflix in participantSubscriptions, ask this question\") or a **loop** (e.g. \"Ask the same followup question about each of the answers they selected\"). There are forms for those as well!\n\n![[CleanShot 2022-05-20 at 17.24.26.png]]\n\n**_Loops_** **and _conditionals_ fall under the broader category of ‚Äúcontrol flow.‚Äù** By default, content (text, questions, charts, images, etc.) are read as instructions, flowing top to bottom. If that feels restrictive, loops and conditionals can declare other rules. A new user can learn how to replicate Google Forms‚Äô functionality in 10-15 minutes without requiring control flow. However, upon learning to use control flow, they will not want to return to the limitations of GUI alternatives.\n\n**Simply adding variables and control flow to a form builder gives people the ability to create their own functionality. Users don‚Äôt need to wait for developers to implement a specific feature.**\n\nOur competitors will advertise that they can do calculations as though that is a noteworthy feature! These calculations are used to score users' responses (in a quiz, for example). In GuidedTrack, calculations are emergent from the way saved variables work. In the case of a quiz, it would look something like: `totalScore = totalScore + lastAnswerScore` after each question.\n\nAnother example: an alternative form builder, Tripetto, is able to take the above question and ask how long the respondent was subscribed to each of the streaming services. The developers of Tripetto needed to specifically design that feature. It takes 20+ clicks (besides typing) and ~3 minutes to do it. That will never get faster.\n\nGuidedTrack doesn‚Äôt have specific functionality for this. We don‚Äôt have a long set of steps. However, control flow makes it possible in 15 lines of code. Most of that code is the same text Tripetto users would have to write anyway. Although it is more advanced than what beginners will need or know how to do [^8], many serious knowledge workers, like course creators or PhD researchers, will need a tool that can scale with their changing goals over the course of a whole career. **GuidedTrack, as programmable text, can handle the increasing demands of users with changing goals** [^9]**. The feedback loops** [^10] **built into the design of its editor enable users to increase their skills as they go** [^11]**.**\n\n**Textual interfaces are as fast as typing.** If writing a question, its answers, and the loop with the follow-up question is 60 words, then it will take you 1-1.5 minutes. **When the syntax feels natural, creating feels like writing.** Most people who use computers know how to type, and have had to use Google or Word documents. The keyboard shortcuts people are familiar with (command-a to select all, command-c to copy, command-v to paste, etc.) all work in a text editor because text editors have worked this all out already! If you try to copy/paste multiple questions at a time in a graphical application like Typeform, you can‚Äôt. If you try to undo an accidental change with command-z, you can‚Äôt. **Graphical applications have to specifically build keyboard shortcuts that text editors can do by default.**\n\nOftentimes, writing and reading is simply more pleasant than dragging and dropping. **Text is incredibly information dense.** Look at the difference between the same survey in GuidedTrack vs. Tripetto. With Tripetto, you would need a massive screen to work with a long survey!\n\n![[CleanShot 2022-05-20 at 17.25.05.png]]\n\n![[CleanShot 2022-05-20 at 17.25.36.png]]\n\nA key problem that confronts domain specific languages attempting to replace standard graphical applications is that they can be intimidating to non-coders. **People who don‚Äôt know how to code will look at anything that looks remotely like code as something that is ‚Äúfor coders.‚Äù** They assume that programming anything requires years of learning and prior experience. For the most part, they are not wrong. The sort of work you hire developers to do often does require specific knowledge.\n\nHowever, we are not trying to be a general purpose programming language like Python or JavaScript that can write anything. We‚Äôre just trying to replace a creation-oriented application with programmable text and a custom IDE. If you have to make a programming language that only makes surveys and experiments, it does not need to be complex. Let‚Äôs say that again more broadly: **If you have to make a programming language that only does ______, it does not need to be complex.**\n\n**Non-coders don‚Äôt need to think about deployment or backend boilerplate.** In order to send the program to someone, they only need to send a link. The program doesn‚Äôt require any code to save all of the responses to a spreadsheet, because why should someone trying to write research have to think of that? All of this complexity is abstracted away for our end users.\n\n**User research clearly demonstrated that novice users felt more comfortable when they could look at code and predict what it would do.** Obviously, that meant we needed users to see simple programs upfront. Unfortunately, we also learned that too many code comments to explain the code actually made code scarier! It is as though that sent the signal that there was more to explain.\n\nOur solution here was to implement a ‚Äúsplit view.‚Äù In the split view, we show users what code _(on the left)_ is actively producing what is displayed in the preview _(on the right)_. Originally, you would need to read code first and then view the preview. With the split view, instead of requiring users to read code and then preview it, they can do both at the same time. This tightened the feedback loop dramatically and enabled us to remove most code comments as they became unnecessary [^12]. Further usability tests were like night and day - we were far less likely to hear the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a coder‚Äù protest. **Legibility is key, and the simple design of the language is complemented by the IDE‚Äôs design.**\n\nIn HCI research, the split view is sort of like a live programming environment, in Bret Victor‚Äôs terms [^13]. We still have substantial work here to improve the experience, but for more, Sketch-n-Sketch [^14] and their research represents the state of the art.\n\n![[CleanShot 2022-05-20 at 17.25.51.png]]\n\nTo sum up, here is what we have so far that can be generalized beyond GuidedTrack:\n\n‚óè The familiarity and speed of text\n\n‚óè The user delivers instructions through text instead of buttons\n\n‚óè Powerful programming concepts like variables and control flows to unlock customized use cases\n\n‚óè Boilerplate code is abstracted away so the user can focus on creation within their domain\n\n‚óè Strong cognitive scaffolding (via graphics or other means) to make sure that it is approachable and people learn as they go\n\n# What other graphical applications could have a programmable text as an interface?\n\nGuidedTrack is awesome, but the point of this piece is to show a new kind of application design. There is no shortage of possibilities here. In no particular order:\n\n1.  **Task managers and schedules.** What better way to express that starting one task depends on finishing another than writing a _conditional_ if-then statement? Isn't a repeating event just an event on a _loop_ until it‚Äôs canceled? Isn‚Äôt it nice to be able to write your todos as though they were on a notepad as opposed to _navigating through a GUI_? With a text editor, it would be easy to copy/paste a selection of tasks to move them into another project. With conditionals, you could create an event that only occurs if half the invitees RSVP yes. This would be more about primitive design than feature design.\n2.  **Diagrams and flowcharts.** See Flowchart.fun [^15] to see how indentation and notation can make flowcharts easy. In order to be more aligned with how I'm looking at it, it would require some level of programmatic control on top of the boxes, lines, and sets of boxes and lines.\n\n![[CleanShot 2022-05-20 at 17.26.18.png]]\n\n3.  **Configuration files.** With most graphical applications, if I‚Äôm using them on multiple computers or across multiple accounts, I will need to manually change the settings each time. If settings were run through text, it's easy to transport through copy/paste.\n4.  **Personal finance.** Many people do this with custom spreadsheets [^16]. You could also do this with a domain-specific language, it might look something like the image from Andrew Blinn [^17] or the pseudocode below.

Those are fine for basic use cases, but as user goals become more advanced, graphics alone will not be enough. This is where programmable text comes in.\n\nText is fast, as fast as we can type. Text can express complicated control flow concepts and abstract repetitive processes to create functionality that the app's designer would never conceive of on their own. Thus, it‚Äôs more about the design of primitives than features. Our job as designers is to make sure people can predict the outcome of their code through communicative feedback loops [^21] and examples they can build on. Clear documentation and graphical scaffolding can help them begin. In order to create a powerful application with a low floor, wide walls, and high ceiling [^22], it is important to think about how people can learn as they go through. Graphics can help people get started, but text will take applications and their users to the next level. If the language is simple, creation will feel like writing. \n\nReferences\n\n[^1]: Wikimedia Foundation. (2021, September 26). _Graphical user interface_. Wikipedia.

We draw specifically on a family of models that describe sensemaking as an iterative search for representations of input data that can make some task easier ([[R- Towards a comprehensive model of the cognitive process and mechanisms of individual sensemaking]], [[R- The Cost Structure of Sensemaking]], [[R- The sensemaking process and leverage points for analyst technology]]). Examples include categorization schemes and comparison tables to facilitate decision-making about what camera to buy, a map of hypotheses for intelligence analysts, and an effective literature review of an area of research.\n\nOne crucial insight from models of sensemaking informs our research on synthesis: sensemaking involves **iterative loops** between [[Search Behavior|searching]] (for data, useful representations) and analysis/composition (classifying data, composing data into representations). This is illustrated well in the following two figures from  following figure from Russell et al's [[Learning Loop Complex]] and Pirolli et al's [[Notional Model of Sensemaking]]:\n\n![[Fig - Learning Loop Complex.png]]\n![[Fig - Notional Model of Sensemaking.png]]\n\nOne implication of this insight are that [[I- Search as a primitive|search is a fundamental primitive of synthesis workflows]] because of the key involvement of search in this process model. Another implication is that [[C- Synthesis tools need to support incremental formalization]] to accomodate constant changes to the representation that are common with open-ended exploratory sensemaking like intelligence analysis (in contrast to well-trodden sensemaking tasks like deciding what camera to buy).\n\nWhile sensemaking is a reasonable general model of the kind of work that is needed to do synthesis, there are likely to be key differences between synthesis and sensemaking, and other everyday tasks of sensemaking, due to the nature of the inputs (complex research papers, theories, findings) and the nature of the output (a boundary-pushing novel conceptual whole with no obvious precedent). These differences are likely to be consequential for understanding precisely what data structures and user interactions can optimize sensemaking for synthesis, since the process and representational requirements of sensemaking (e.g., whether the representation that is constructed has the shape of a map or timeline or argument, how much iteration and search for representations must happen) vary as a function of the task. Thus, our project tackles core research questions about the [[Q- What workflows and behaviors facilitate synthesis | workflows]] and [[Q- What is the data structure of a graph built to facilitate decentralized knowledge synthesis | data structures]] that optimize synthesis, and how to build on this for decentralized synthesis. Some hypotheses include the importance of [[I- Search as a primitive|search as a primitive]], and the importance of design patterns like [[incremental formalization]] and [[flexible compression]].\n\nUnderstanding how people perform synthesis is one of our open questions going into [[Interview Guide|user interviews]]. \n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:05.916606122Z","tags":null},"/C-Synthesis-is-hard-to-do-with-people-who-dont-share-context-with-you":{"title":"C- Synthesis is hard to do with people who don‚Äôt share context with you","content":"\nAuthored By::  [[P- Joel Chan]], [[P- Rob Haisfield]], [[P- Brendan Langen]]\n\nAn exciting hypothesis that motivates our work is that making discourse graphs widely available could accelerate human synthesis work, and thereby accelerate innovation and scientific discovery. [[C- Effective synthesis is necessary for innovation and scientific progress|C- Effective synthesis is necessary for innovation and scientific progress]]. Yet, our first challenge is to enable people to perform distributed synthesis. For many people, this is a challenge!\n\n## Synthesis typically occurs in one mind\n\nSynthesis involves individuals putting together many pieces in their minds, but It is often argued that [synthesis occurs in a single mind](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Great_creative_work_is_usually_the_product_of_a_single_person). In our research, surprisingly few participants had distributed synthesis experiences to share. Why? \n\nIn the early stages of synthesis, when people have [[half-baked ideas not ready yet]], they prefer to work on their own or with a close companion.\n\nFor most people, the primary concern is speed. If you are working with someone who has no shared background, you need to spend time explaining the basics - of the topic, your goals, and your working process - to them. \n\nAs [[P- Ryan Singer]] describes in [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup), the most efficient synthesis occurs when you can cover a breadth of topics quickly. This can only happen if you are able to leave out details as you go. When you are on your own or with a trusted collaborator with shared context, you do not need to re-explain things you already understand, using a \"shorthand\" instead.\n\n\u003e First, we need to have the right people‚Äîor nobody‚Äîin the room. Either we‚Äôre working alone or with a trusted partner who can keep pace with us. Someone we can speak with in shorthand, who has the same background knowledge, and who we can be frank with as we jump between ideas.\n\nHere, the primary concern is being able to [[work at the speed of thought]]. Bringing someone else up to speed[^1] - especially someone with a [[lack of shared context]] - slows the process down and reduces the chances of advancing beyond the basics.  \n\nThis lack of shared context makes it difficult to divide the work of synthesis collaboratively. \n- [[B1]] gave an example from his own experience where he was working on a knowledge graph project with people who did not have a background in knowledge graphs. They had 10 sources and divided them up so each person would look at different sources and take notes on them. When [[B1]] read his sources, he took notes in the context of what was relevant to the project, whereas his collaborators would write summaries of the entire sources. They did not fully understand the driving questions and history of the space, so they had no filter for relevance.\n- [[R2]] mentioned that when he reads a paper, he only takes notes on what is relevant for his current projects. While he does have rigorous processes for taking notes on a particularly juicy paper, he finds that often [[C- It is difficult to predict whether structure now will be worthwhile later]].\n\n## Shared context is critical to distributed synthesis\n\nThus, we see that **shared context** is critical to distributed synthesis. When multiple people share context, they can advance their collective understanding of the topic through conversation and standardized processes and conventions. \n\nTo have shared context, people must be on the same page. Their working styles align. They understand how what they're examining should fit into their overall goal. They are aware of the nuance in the field(s) they're researching. In simple terms, they know how to work with one another on the problem they're working on.   \n\nBut there is a very significant barrier to team-based convergence because of this bottleneck of not being able to have a shared \"dataset\" of ideas that satisfy the properties. Our external representations that are **shareable** lack one or more of those properties. \n\nWhen we did see distributed synthesis in our research, people would almost always bring someone else into their work through a feedback role, as that lowers the burden of the shared dataset requirement. \n\nInstead of involving peers in the full synthesis process, [[B5]] would ask concise questions to his peers that would support him  [[B5]] and [[R10]] seek feedback only from trusted individuals. B5 comes up with a pitch, bringing people along his line of questioning. He wants to present others with a gateway into the topic he's exploring. \n\nOftentimes, his solution to get people up to speed is a **gateway analogy,** where he presents his idea through the lens of one his audience might understand.\n\nIn our interviews, virtually everyone struggled to bring other people up to speed on their projects, but the theme of a **collective narrative** emerged as a pattern of people who are on the same page.\n\nAt this point, the synthesizer would either find an individual with shared context, or they would need to come up with a concise framing to act as gateway analogies and simple entry points to share. \n\nTo find those entry points, [[B5]] considers the following questions: What's a common way to frame this that others can relate to? How can I get someone else to think this is their own idea? What will help someone else get it? What motivated the project?\n\nOthers talked about conversations as a framing mechanism to drive the process of synthesis.  [[R16]] uses [[conversations, chats with others]] as her primary form of synthesis. She finds the form of chat to be more conversational and feels its easier to solve a problem with an audience in mind or if you're talking to someone.  For her, the very act of framing the thoughts so her partner could understand clarifies her thinking.\n\n## Find or create shared context\nThis suggests two categories of solutions to enable synthesis with others:\n1. **Connect people who share context.** This remains an area for further research, but obvious solutions include finding other people who write about similar concepts or enabling the formation of communities and querying for overlap between people.\n2. **Design mechanisms to help people gain context quickly.** In order to do this, we would need to facilitate knowledge transfer from experts to beginners. This is a difficult problem. As described earlier, experts prefer to work on their own or with people who already share context **because** their ability to move fast depends on omitting the basics.

It's devilishly tricky to make systems that support formalism that users will actually use (without a gun to their head).\n\nTools for synthesis that attempt to incorporate formalism typically have an extremely high barrier to entry *and* ongoing burden on the user. This overhead is exceedingly difficult to overcome for any kind of ongoing work.\n\nThese problems are well-documented in the classic \"Formality Considered Harmful: Experiences, Emerging Themes, and Directions on the Use of Formal Representations in Interactive Systems\" [[R- Formality Considered Harmful]]. In brief, this paper identifies four classes of difficulties:\n1. **Cognitive overhead**: often the task of specifying formalism is extraneous to the primary task, or is just plain annoying to do\n2. **Tacit knowledge**: if relevant info for developing formalism is tacit, asking people to formalize it will interrupt the task, with serious consequences for the quality of the work\n3. **Enforcing Premature Structure**: people don't want to commit until they're sure what formalism is actually useful for their task (and what's extraneous and only annoying) \n4.  **Situational Structure**: Useful structures and formalisms vary significantly across people, situations, and tasks\n\nThe last two (premature and situational structure) are particularly relevant for open-ended synthesis work.\n\nOne powerful general design pattern for overcoming these risks of formality is [[incremental formalization]]. The basic intuition is described well by [[R- Formality Considered Harmful]]: users enter information in a mostly informal fashion, and then incrementally formalize later in the task as appropriate formalisms become more clear and also (more) immediately useful. \n\n[[R- Formality Considered Harmful]] notes a few example systems that help flesh out the concept (these are all older systems, mostly research systems, so unfortunately they're not available to play with):\n    1.  In the Hyper-Object Substrate system, users enter mostly informal text initially, and the system recognizes patterns in the textual information to suggest possible formal attributes or relations for the underlying knowledge base, which the user can then accept/modify/reject as they wish (p. 347).\n    2.  Infoscope is a news reader system that suggests filters based on users' reading patterns; this helps them make their goals explicit which can facilitate formalization after it emerges from their task behaviors (p. 347-348)\n    3.  VIKI is a spatial hypertext system that includes heuristic algorithms to find recurring visual/spatial patterns in layout of objects; users can use these to specify schemas if they wish\n\nAnother more recent example comes from [[R- Gui ‚Äî Phooey]]: their Jourknow system includes a variety of features that can recognize formal structure (e.g., location, time, meeting information) from (relatively) unstructured notes in pidgin or more lightweight entry format, such as [[Notation3]] (p. 195-197)\n\nOther examples of this in production systems include Todoist recognizing keyphrases like \"today\" to add formal date information to todos, or Gmail recognizing potential formal event data from an email when you create a calendar event while an email is open.\n\nIncremental formalization addresses the cognitive overhead problem by spreading it throughout the task a bit more evenly, as well as removing it mostly from the earlier parts of the task, where minimal friction is needed to maximize exploration. It also helps with the premature and situational structure problems, since you don't have to commit early on to a structure that may not serve you well (or even hurt your performance) later on.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:05.916606122Z","tags":null},"/C-The-responsibilities-required-to-produce-synthesis-can-be-split-up-among-many-people":{"title":"C- The responsibilities required to produce synthesis can be split up among many people","content":"Authored By:: [[P- Rob Haisfield]], [[P- Brendan Langen]]\n\n[[Q- What synthesis behaviors must be done by an individual and what responsibilities can be distributed to many people]]?\n\n[[Q- What user behavior is required to grow a decentralized discourse graph|As a discourse graph grows]], the process of maintenance becomes more difficult.

[[B12]] [[R10]] [[B2]]\n\nWhen people write about the same concepts repeatedly, inevitably their words take different forms. This is often a positive. One participant told us that this helps her speak more fluidly about ideas with others. For her, writing multiple outlines and drafts is a practice that helps her figure out how to articulate her thoughts and learn what her points are. In the process, she will often generate new insights. For her and many others, multiplicity enables synthesis.\n\nHowever, this multiplicity comes with challenges. Current thought processors are not well equipped for multiple frames around the same idea. Some participants experienced difficulty identifying the canonical version of an idea, overwhelmed in their search results with information that was largely repetitive (albeit with different wording) across drafts, outlines, and snippets. Their tooling is unable to recognize that all of that content is about fundamentally the same thing.\n\n## Ideas for overcoming this challenge:\n\n**A logical solution might include continuously editing a single document, dodging multiplicity entirely.** One of our participants was borderline offended at the notion that she would repeat her work by creating multiple versions. However, this may create a premature structure that adds friction at the point of idea entry, depending on discipline in user behavior. For example, if people come up with a new idea in a flash and they need to think about where it fits into an outline before they write it down, they might lose their train of thought. A common refrain we heard from participants was: [[If I‚Äôm thinking too hard about structure before I write the note, I forget what I was going to write down]]. The effort put into this structuring may not be worth it.\n\n**Many people don't like to update original copies, often preferring to ossify an old outline as still potentially useful while making a new one for the purpose of iteration.** [[People don‚Äôt intentionally review old notes]].\n\nThis is comparable to save points in an RPG game ‚Äì when you have a difficult choice about a document, you can create a fork to see what the outcome would be, and revert back. Multiplicity enables playfulness and experimental behavior, a key driver for synthesis. Requiring users to mutate the original copy can lead to a loss of provenance to the initial idea or source.\n\n**Multiplicity also presents an issue for people who need to manage multiple versions of the same document.** For example, the authors all share a folder of markdown files. They each have personal notes, which use the same titles, for [[half-baked ideas not ready yet]]. Then they have more refined versions of a subsection of those notes in another directory to publish as a hypertext notebook. There is currently no way for the authors to reference and maintain all of the versions of a note at once as semantically the same \"thing.\" Transclusion is not the solution, as each version necessarily presents different and has different permissions for different people. Each page has its own backlinks section, and there is no simple way to compose all of the backlinks for each version into one view.\n\nSummary TL;DR\n\n- Leaving ideas and notes in various places is a common default action that keeps us in flow, able to [[work at the speed of thought]]. Provided we return to write about the same concept, this multiplicity leads to diversity and playfulness in our ideas. Of course, this makes it difficult to accrete knowledge and can feel overwhelming when we sit down to compile our work.\n- Our tools don‚Äôt help us here! Direct search fails to find all related instances to our ideas, and presentation of multiple versions is a UI challenge. Potential ideas to overcome this take advantage of implicit structure.\n    -   [[I- searchable blobs as unnamed groups enable unnamed formalization]]\n    -   [[I- Workspaces as a primitive]], as seen in Codex OS, can infer structure from what entities are present in a workspace for later retrieval.","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:05.916606122Z","tags":null},"/C-User-behavior-within-a-well-designed-choice-architecture-can-be-a-signal-of-preferences":{"title":"C- User behavior within a well-designed choice architecture can be a signal of preferences","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:05.916606122Z","tags":null},"/C-Wikum-allows-you-to-summarize-groups-of-comments-on-a-Hacker-News-style-forum":{"title":"C- Wikum allows you to summarize groups of comments on a Hacker News style forum","content":"\nAuthored By:: [[P- Rob Haisfield]]\n\n[[Wikum|Wikum]] is a tool for recursive summarization in internet forums, with an aim to help readers see a summary tree of the main points of discussion. \n\nThis was first published by [[Amy Zhang]], [[Lea Verou]], and [[David Karger]] at CSCW 2017. \n\nThis paper has made significant traction in the para-academic HCI / tools for thought community. \n\nExample: [[P- Max Krieger]] in [[R- Chatting with Glue]] references [[Wikum|Wikum]], and this piece has made significant waves in this community outside of academic HCI (unclear to me how much impact Krieger's piece has had within academic HCI)\n\nSupports:: [[I- a primitive for composing pages to encapsulate meaning]]\n\n[[C- Retroactive funding incentivizes support because it's easier to agree on what was useful than what will be useful in the future]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:05.916606122Z","tags":null},"/CG-comment-1":{"title":"CG-comment-1","content":"[[P- Chris Granger]]: This is one of those things we actually feel strongly about too. Every decision the system makes is one you should be able to make yourself directly.

The big thing here though is that specifying it shouldn't mean you need to describe every detail like you would in C. Most tools are either fully implicit or fully explicit and the few that allow you to go from implicit to explicit throw you down into a hole from a simple world where everything was decided for you to a world where you have to define everything explicitly to make progress.\n\n[[P- Chris Granger]]: One principle that we didn't talk about is the idea that you ought to be able to work at the level of abstraction that makes the most sense for the task at hand. E.g. if I were working with a designer, I might say \"let's try something more red\" but if I¬†_were_¬†the designer, I'd want a color wheel to explicitly set the color. We should be able to talk very high level about the parts of the system that don't really matter to us, but be explicitly about the parts that do.

Jump isn't exactly in stealth but it also isn't something [[P- Chris Granger]] talks about much publicly yet. During our research, we talked with Chris and afterwards, he asked for feedback, so I wrote up a google doc to send to him. With his permission, I've included it here. His comments on the doc were insightful as well, so I've included them as hyperlinks to their own pages.*\n\nHey Chris, thank you again for taking the time to interview! Most of the Roam and Notion forks are dedicated to making faster horses, meanwhile you're creating a self-driving, KITT augmented hovercraft. It's sort of like the holy grail OS of end-user computing, and I wish you the best of luck with it. Presuming successful execution, I fully expect this to be a paradigm shift. Based on your experience and career leading up to Jump, you're one of the best people to work on it.\n\nYou asked for my perspective on what you shared and what you might be missing, and I said I would reflect and get back to you. Your work pre-Jump has given you a complete conceptual framework and thesis. In many ways, [[Q- Does sufficiently advanced natural language processing invalidate the need for a structured DSL|Jump is one possible set of logical conclusions for the questions we've been asking]], and, if you were to look over my knowledge graph, you would likely find it hilarious in its similarity.\n\nIt feels almost audacious to say you're missing anything with Jump, as what you revealed in our conversation and the demo are a subset of all of your research. Regardless, I leave this for your consideration. When we have more to share of our own research, I'll appreciate your analysis of what we're missing.\n\nNot making a user tell you something twice is a powerful design principle. I'm sure you will be able to infer a large amount of structure for free. However, I can't shake the feeling that [[CG-comment-1|automatic inferences from my language would deprive me the fine grained control I want]], particularly in creating data structures. I imagine there will have to be some balance. Your molecular schemata approach may be enough. The philosophical difference is that I do not believe revealed preferences are everything. [[CG-comment-2|If a computer can't infer my goals perfectly from my behavior]], then what more powerful tool¬† do I have than manual controls to tell the computer what exactly my goals are? There is something to a manual tool that gives me 100% legibility over how the computer will interpret my inputs.\n\nI have been exploring the idea of a [[I- A DSL for a discourse graph with information entry, visualization, and retrieval|DSL for synthesis and decision making]] (where the data at the base is not necessarily a text file), and one notion I'm playing with is writing sentences with custom inline data structures. [[CG-comment-3|Nesting blocks within sentences as a replacement for words]]. One could synthesize our approaches ‚Äî Jump makes the data structures in the background and the user confirms that they are correct.\n\nGenerally, I've been exploring what I refer to as \"semantic self-expression\" in software. For example, [[Roam Research]] infers indentation in an outline to mean branching or nested thought, and encodes that relationship for the sake of querying and filtering linked references. To me, this felt like Roam gave me a way to communicate what was related to what so it could excel at answering my questions. You can find some design suggestions for visualizing those relationships and supporting exploratory browsing in my [onboarding Roamgames submission](https://www.figma.com/file/5shwLdUCHxSaPNEO7pazbe/Dhrumil%26Robert---RoamGames-Challenge-2?node-id=0%3A1). Other mechanisms that fall within your selection and refactoring framework include conditional formatting, possibly where the conditions are synthesized by the computer after the user has manually formatted information, possibly through something like Codex Editor's standoff annotation.\n\nI want to be sure that those schemata are not just what's formed from the dictionary and thesaurus, but also that I am [[CG-comment-4|appending custom phrases and coinages as I go]]. The dictionary and thesaurus provide information, but the phrases for how I compose labeled ideas is more important. I do not expect most interdisciplinary conceptual links to share words. (See Andy Matuschak's [note titles as APIs](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3XP5GRmd9z1D2qCE7pxUvbeSVeQuMiqz9x1C) and arguments for [concept oriented notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6bci25mVUBNFdVWSrQNKr6u7AZ1jFzfTVbMF))\n\nYou chose to organize exploratory browsing such that it would maximize surprise in the information theory sense of the word ‚Äî it must communicate something new that does not feel trivial to the perceiver. I'm not sure¬† the implications on user behavior would be to this. If your system is actively guiding people in their exploration, then you have a responsibility to guide appropriately. We've seen downstream implications of social media newsfeed algorithm optimizations so it's an important design space.\n\nHowever, computer augmented synthesis as a series of scaffolded surprises is certainly a compelling idea. It‚Äôs rare to see a behavioral perspective this refined. As such, I believe that the process of synthesis can be made intensely fun for participants through explicit choices.\n\nAlong those lines, I've been playing with two things. One is that the [[CG-comment-5|the choice architecture can present choices]] that [[C- User behavior within a well-designed choice architecture can be a signal of preferences|reveal user preferences]], similar to how we were talking about how the most useful thing a user can do is reveal their goals and have a conversation with Jump. Another is that there are fascinating interface possibilities with respect to giving users direct feedback loops and [[CG-comment-5|control over the algorithms]] serving them content.\n\nTo reveal user preferences on an exploratory browsing/search interface, one approach would be allowing people to [[C- Highlighted and lowlighted search results map to how well results map to intentions|emphasize and de-emphasize information]], and encode the searches and their results accordingly. If queries are statements of intent, result prioritization is a confirmation that the computer has an accurate model.\n\nYour notion of building out a molecular schema that filters down the overall knowledge graph based on only the information it has and local context radiating outward is powerful. When people say they like an app because it works like their brain does, they don't know what‚Äôs coming. In your position, I would strongly consider how you can infer what is the most contextually relevant information based on how people write, lay out information, and relate it. I expect your refactoring tools will enable people to adjust structure top down as well.\n\nI think you are underestimating the sheer amount of information that can be gathered from crowdsourced user behavior from many people performing varied roles on the same content. Leaving questions for others to answer, emphasizing and de-emphasizing content, curating trails, curating curated trails, etc. Additionally, given how much you have reduced the friction to add metadata to content, a crowdsourced semantic web may become more feasible than it was before.\n\nIt also appears that you have not fully considered social coordination design to support lofty augmented collective thinking goals. As we discussed, this is a behavioral influence question, and as you mentioned, some percentage of the difficulty here has to do with current incentives around sharing. However, [[CG-comment-6|your goal seems more neutral about what people will do with Jump]], so that may not be important.\n\nTokens‚Äîfinancial, reputational, or otherwise, can support overall social coordination. For example, compensating users for supporting other users (answering questions, building plugins, leading onboarding sessions, etc.). However, crypto Web3 people haven't fully considered how software design influences user behavior and overweight tokens.\n\nYou mentioned that people don't always know what questions they are asking. The best thing to provide them with is an exploratory browsing experience. I wonder if, in those situations, there might be opportunities to prompt awareness and help them formulate a question. Your hypothesis that browsing with expanded context will lead them to generate a question is valid.\n\n[[I- Search as a primitive|Selection]], refactoring, and copies are a solid set of primitive concepts. [[CG-comment-7|The workflows to search]] / browse and work with that information as users go are crucial. For example, in Roam, one of their expectations is that as you're browsing backlinks or query results, you block reference them into an outline in the Daily Notes and annotating what you have determined as important, or editing results in place. Obsidian's search is arguably more complete, but incorporating the results into your current thinking is more difficult due to the UX because it shows all of the results but requires you to click and navigate. If you look at [part three of my Roamgames submission,](https://www.figma.com/file/5shwLdUCHxSaPNEO7pazbe/Dhrumil%26Robert---RoamGames-Challenge-2?node-id=0%3A1) you will see an interface that shows relevant notes, updates legibly based on new information, and enables the user to manually emphasize and de-emphasize relationships. That's all based on indentation, the slider, and filters. What's missing is an intelligent backend that's able to interpret the user inputs and log those _in conjunction with_ the searches as a meaningful input for the future.\n\nI would keep pulling at the Gigjam string. People bringing their knowledge graphs together [[CG-comment-8|without sharing too much of the total graph]] is not an easy problem at all and [keeps Joel Chan up at night](https://twitter.com/JoelChan86/status/1309521782806847490?s=20\u0026t=Y2_Y5xPm7X6NJAfkfO2_0A).\n\nA few miscellaneous thoughts that came to mind as we were going:\n\n-   I would prompt you to think more about [[CG-comment-9|how multiple people think together in Jump.]] Apps like Roam make the implicit assumption that synthesis happens in one mind. A computer augmenting a person is powerful, but so is a computer/other people. I believe that scaffolding built for decentralized synthesis looks a lot like a social network (with different goals than social media).\n-   You often said things like \"there ought to be a way for the system to recognize the conceptual similarity\" and my first thought each time was to replace \"system\" with \"multi-human/computer system.\" [[CG-comment-10|In your thought experiment, everything that requires difficult behavior change seems to be left to the computer]]. I'll be pondering that for a while.\n-   The insight that the most useful thing a user can do is reveal their goals explicitly and have a conversation with the tool is powerful. Additionally, that common goals for a domain can be prebuilt, it's just that nobody does it.\n-   Creating programs in the background for users is a powerful notion. A key problem we‚Äôve noticed in a lot of our user interviews is aspirational systems that people can‚Äôt seem to keep up with. This may be a way to decrease entropy over the entire system as quantity increases.\n-   Apart from knowledge management, I want to use Jump to handle my DeFi taxes. I'm imagining uploading CSVs, making rules about how I want interactions with certain smart contracts to be treated. Many DeFi users are feeling the pain of waiting for tax software developers to update and include new protocols given the rapid pace of innovation.\n-   I would love to chat with you about your user research in this space. It's clear how zooming out on your career, your work on Microsoft's assisted coding, Light Table, Eve, and Looker all played into your product-instantiated insights for Jump, but it's also clear that you studied your users more than most.\n-   I'd love to hear you elaborate on, \"Decentralized apps with a P2P backend feel different than cloud based apps in that you build a more direct relationship with it.\"\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:05.97260585Z","tags":null},"/Figma":{"title":"Figma","content":"Authored by:: [[P- Brendan Langen]]\n\nFigma is a collaborative design tool that enables rapid brainstorming, prototyping, and iteration.

They could feasibly go through spreadsheets, canvases, and block based editors as well. The point is that the syntax will allow people to communicate more information and metadata than simply writing a document with natural english would. The notation would allow people to create data structures and operate on them. People will have prebuilt, high level, declarative functions, like `query`, `sort`, `group`, `view-as-map`, `create-table` etc. that are unintimidating to use, and they will be able to create custom functions.\n\nThese functions could be simple to both create and call.

I've written elsewhere about how that interface could be extended as the basis for [end-user scripting](https://robhaisfield.com/notes/end-user-scripting-enables-creative-workarounds). In [[Notion|Notion]] and [[Roam Research]], they use slash commands to call functions on a block. This can more or less be thought of as [[autocomplete]]. In [[Emacs]], they use the infamous M-X. [[Nextjournal]] implements [[R- clojureD 2021- Command and Conquer- Learnings from Decades of Code Editing by Philippa Markovics]], where it only shows you the functions that are possible given your context. \n\n![[Pasted image 20210930175757.png]]\n\nAdditionally, not all information that is entered needs to be code. For example, a [[Literate programming interface]] might have a block based editor where the text in each block is understood as writing unless otherwise specified as a code block. The default assumption for a DSL for a discourse graph would likely be the same. One can also look at [[Pollen]] as an example for inline coding. There, you write prose normally, but when you want to apply a function to text within your prose you use a unique identifier, like using the following ‚óäem{to bold} what is within the curly brackets. This syntactical form is referred to as an X-Expression.\n\n[[Q- What are powerful primitives for a user of a decentralized knowledge graph]]? [[Roam Research]] is able to infer which page and block references are related to each other from collocation in a block or in a branch of an indentation tree. Indentation can be considered a core part of their syntax. Each page and block has a unique ID, and whenever those IDs are referenced in another block, those IDs are related to the block through a children-nodes attribute. [[Q- What are powerful interfaces for entering information into a discourse graph]]?\n\nWhile text is an interface for information entry, the end visualizations need not be limited to text. [Flowchart.fun](https://flowchart.fun/) is able to infer a flowchart structure from indentation, attributes, and references. This serves as a useful expansion to the meaning inferred from indentation.\n\n![[Pasted image 20210913182317.png]]\n\nWe do not yet know what the syntax for our discourse graph will be. This will certainly be informed by our explorations of [[Q- What is the data structure of a graph built to facilitate decentralized knowledge synthesis]] and user interviews.\n\nHowever, typed edges and nodes are an expressive backbone, as can be seen with [[Hode]]. Hode allows you to create edge and node relationships between items fluidly as you write. It then allows you treat a set of items with a relationship as an entity that can have relationships with other ideas.\n\nOn the extreme end, one might ask, \"Do we need to have defined ontologies, or can AI or neural networks replace databases?\" We might also ask, [[Q- Does sufficiently advanced natural language processing invalidate the need for a structured DSL]]? *See [[R- Neural Databases]].* \n\n[[C- Programmable text interfaces are the future]]. Text is familiar and fast. When you replace buttons with functions and add control flow / abstraction, it unlocks powerful custom use cases. Structural editors and other means can facilitate the growth of newcomers, who are able to gain value from the beginning, towards expertise, where they will never want to use anything else.\n\nBy allowing people to write data structures and queries inline, we allow for [[Literate programming interface|literate programming]]. When people include a number, they can also include the formula or query that results in displaying that value. In that way, readers would be able to verify the evidence. \n![[Pasted image 20211117170352.png]]","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:05.984605792Z","tags":null},"/I-Enable-composable-queries-to-facilitate-structure-in-hindsight":{"title":"I- Enable composable queries to facilitate structure in hindsight","content":"Authored By:: [[P- Rob Haisfield]]\n\n[[I- Populate the related items section through a search term|If a page's related items section is defined through a search term]], then we can think of the page title and its query as a key-value pair. This might look something like the code snippet below.\n\nHere you'll notice a general pattern in the queries, where there's an \"any\" clause that always includes the base title in the search results. This is essentially a smart default - references to the page title are almost always going to be relevant. Then you'll see additional terms. In the first example, I'm saying that a result has to include either \"structure\" OR \"structuring\" as well as \"hindsight.\" Any time something is within parentheses, think of it as one term.\n\n``` clojure\n;; \n\n\"PCT\" means\n  (any: \"PCT\"\n        \"Perceptual Control Theory\")\n\n\"SDT\" means\n  (any: \"SDT\"\n        \"Self-Determination Theory\")\n\n;; \"Behavioral Science Theories\" = pages whose titles match Behavioral Science Theories or either SDT or PCT\n\"Behavioral Science Theories\" means\n  (any: \"Behavioral Science Theories\"\n        (any: \"SDT\"\n              \"PCT\"))\n              \n\"Theories\" means\n  (any: \"Behavioral Science Theories\"\n        \"Political Science Theories\"\n        \"Biology Theories\")\n\n\"structure in hindsight\" means \n  (any: \"structure in hindsight\" \n        (all: (any: \"structure\" \"structuring\")\n              \"hindsight\")\n              \n\"structure in foresight\" means \n  (any: \"structure in foresight\" \n        (all: (any: \"structure\" \"structuring\")\n              \"foresight\")\n              \n\"structuring across time\" means\n        (any: \"structure in hindsight\"\n              \"structure in foresight\")\n\n```\n\nOver time, composable queries fight entropy. We would frequently see people create multiple pages that mean the same thing simply because their body of notes had grown so large that they didn't remember they had already created other pages to refer to the same concept. \n\nThis is a huge challenge of adding structure! In our private research notebook, we refer to this problem of entropy from structure in multiple ways (for example, `[[Q- How might we prevent workflow entropy]]`and `[[I- Enable composable queries to reduce system entropy]]`). With the solution we're proposing, we could adjust the query for the idea page to bring in references to the question page, or we could create a new, encompassing page with a query that brings in references to either.\n\nWe aim to [[work at the speed of thought]], but too much structure creates paralyzing cognitive overhead. [[C- An increasing amount of structure leads to entropy]], pointing to the importance of [[smart default|smart defaults]].\n\n[[Roam Research]] enables users to merge pages together. This affordance aims to solve issues where users have created multiple pages for similar ideas, but the results are different in practice. When two pages represent conceptually \"close\" concepts, users consistently link blocks to both pages to ensure linked references show up on each page. Merging is not always appropriate.\n\nOver time, these duplicate links pile up, and users feel the need to link to a large vocabulary of pages, which brings us back to square one with [[Repeat work]]. Their system's surface area has greatly increased in size, and they're reliant on their own memory to recall each new link they add. Ultimately, this leads to system collapse or abandonment.  \n\nMultiplayer amplifies the problem, [[Q- How do we solve the problem of different people referring to the same concept with different language|as different people refer to similar concepts with different language]].\n\nComposable queries enable people to create both aliases and hierarchies. Aided by the full expressiveness of a query language, composable searches empower people to build up their own semantic dictionary and thesaurus over time. As the queries can be adjusted at any point, this is a promising solution to the question: [[Q- How might we allow people to adapt their past system and notes to current needs]]?\n\nOf note: users who have created many layers of abstraction through these mechanisms may eventually end up with a system that is difficult to reason about. For example, someone may not be able to understand at first glance why a related items section or query contains certain results due to all of the propagation. At this point, we don't know if that would actually be a problem or not, but to go further down the [[I- A DSL for a discourse graph with information entry, visualization, and retrieval]] metaphor, there may be a requirement for \"debugging\" tools, enabling users to peer into their layers of abstraction.","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:05.984605792Z","tags":null},"/I-Populate-the-related-items-section-through-a-search-term":{"title":"I- Populate the related items section through a search term","content":"\nAuthored By:: [[P- Rob Haisfield]], [[P- Brendan Langen]]\n\nIn the [[Q- How might we navigate the structure now or later tradeoffs|structure now vs. later]] tradeoff, people tend to [[[Why people prefer to structure later or not at all|defer structuring until later]]) or not structure at all. Search is the primary tool people have available for resurfacing unstructured information. However, search can be extended to be the basis for creating structure in hindsight. As explored in [[I- Search as a primitive]] within [[I- A DSL for a discourse graph with information entry, visualization, and retrieval]].\n\nFor example, a page titled `[[Behavioral science theories]]` could have a \"related items\" section defined by a search for `[[Behavioral science theories]]` or any time any specific theory (e.g. `[[Perceptual Control Theory]]` or `[[Self-Determination Theory]]`) is mentioned.\n\nThe search might look like: `any: [[Behavioral science theories]] [[Perceptual Control Theory]] [[Self-Determination Theory]]` \n\nThese searches could then be composable, enabling more efficient categorization. For example, I might have a page titled `[[Theories]]` with an \"associated items\" section defined by the \"associated items\" sections for `[[Behavioral science theories]]` and `[[Biology theories]]`. \n\nAlternatively, a page titled `[[Intersection points in user experiences]]` could have a related items section defined as a search for any block or page that mentions multiple user names at a time.\n\nThere are few things that are more expressive than a search. [[C- Search terms express intentions]]. Through logical operators like ANY, ALL, NOT, IF, and custom relational rules people are able to express precisely what they consider relevant and in which contexts. *Logical operators and query syntax are subject to future debate.* There could be graph query operators, for example, that indicate \"show me anything within 2 degrees of connection to this node.\"\n\nNow let's get fancy with it, to show more interesting examples of what is possible for [[structure in hindsight]] and [[structure in foresight]].\n\nSee, for example, how I map Roam queries to English questions so I'm able to find an answer [in minutes 20-30 of this video](https://youtu.be/47A0gK7Vo8E?t=1200). Those questions did not have a set of backlinks because there was no single page to backlink to! If I created a new page for each question, the backlinks would be empty until after I had searched through my notes and manually added linked references to the question page. By creating a query, I was able to say: \"All blocks that match these rules are relevant to this question, even if there is not an explicit reference to this question.\"\n\nEffectively, this enabled me to process past notes in bulk. [[C- A decentralized discourse graph is dynamic]], and wrangling past data into new slots through search is one way to answer the question: [[Q- How might we allow people to adapt their past system and notes to current needs]]? Queries like this reduce work going forward, as they mean I don't need to remember to reference a specific page every time if there are other mechanisms for inclusion into a related items section.  \n\nThe above example points towards another powerful use for queries: Smart folders. \n\nMost file systems require you to manually add files into different folders. Keeping these folders up to date can be a challenging job. The same problem holds true for note taking apps where you need to manually place a tag or bidirectional link in order to put ideas into buckets. [In Apple's Finder](https://www.howtogeek.com/403077/how-to-automate-your-mac-with-smart-folders/), you have the ability to create smart folders. These smart folders are populated by the results of a search, so they autoupdate when new content is added to your file system that matches certain criteria. In essence, this enables you to create organization systems now to capture knowledge in the future. \n\nI remember how my mind was blown when I first saw [[P- Allen Wilsonn]] link a tweet [to a search](https://twitter.com/AGWilsonn/status/1265760007414579206). This was just an early example of a powerful new behavior.\n\n![[Pasted image 20210916173736.png]]","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:05.984605792Z","tags":null},"/I-Provide-Push-and-Pull-as-inline-syntax-to-affect-the-related-items-section-for-a-page":{"title":"I- Provide Push and Pull as inline syntax to affect the related items section for a page","content":"Authored By:: [[P- Rob Haisfield]]\n\nAs mentioned on [[I- Replace the backlinks section of a page with a related items section]], [[C- Linked references are a smart default for related items]] but are not a complete description of what is related.

[[Agora]] provides an ergonomic solution with their Push and Pull mechanisms.\n\nWithin [[Agora]], if you are writing on a page and believe the backlinks for another page would be relevant, you can write `[[pull]] [[page2]]`. Push does the opposite, pushing backlinks from the page you are writing on to another page's backlinks section.\n\nFor example, imagine you have a page called `[[Graph Core Protocol Development Teams]]`. On that page, you could `pull` references from each team into the related items section of development teams page. The search term that populates the related items section would adjust in response to uses of `push` and `pull`, looking something like *(syntax isn't final)* `(any: [[Graph Core Protocol Development Team]] [[Edge \u0026 Node]] [[Figment]] [[Semiotic.ai]] [[StreamingFast]] [[The Guild]])`\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:05.984605792Z","tags":null},"/I-Replace-the-backlinks-section-of-a-page-with-a-related-items-section":{"title":"I- Replace the backlinks section of a page with a related items section","content":"Authored By:: [[P- Rob Haisfield]], [[P- Brendan Langen]]\n\nWe can [[I- Populate the related items section through a search term]].

We suspect these queries will reduce system entropy over time.\n\nGiven that search terms can be defined to bring in a broader array of stuff than a simple list of backlinks, users will require a way to filter their results.

Unseen mentions would be filtered out through the addition of a link like `[[seen]]`.\n\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fwrite-hypertext-notebook-graph-research%2Fdri1S1LNrf.png?alt=media\u0026token=90e1df22-759e-4bed-a401-6b967d7198dd)\n\nThis actually isn't far off from a proper notifications system.

The main adjustment would be to [ping the user when a new item enters the unseen query](https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-01-25-notifications-in-roam-research/). Roam users have hacked around this by writing plugins that would ping them on Slack whenever there was a new mention.\n\nFrom a [[primitive design]] perspective, users would need the ability to set up automations, to include \"new result enters query\" as a trigger, and \"send notification\" as an action. From there, the user could define what would notify them by adjusting search terms. This is further enabled by [[I- Enable composable queries to facilitate structure in hindsight|composable queries]]. \n\nIt is important to note that not everyone wants to go through the effort to create their own notifications system, hence the importance of smart defaults.

It often features \"suggestions\" outside of who you follow based on its perception of your interests.\n\nAt its simplest, a newsfeed could be considered an aggregate of your saved queries.

We operate in different contexts over different stages of work, and while our tools are moving towards flexible interfaces, there is still too much of a one-size-fits-all approach in current user interfaces.\n\nExpert users tend to prefer tools that either share their opinion or are neutral enough to enable them to impose their opinion onto the tool, and not vice versa.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:05.984605792Z","tags":null},"/I-searchable-blobs-as-unnamed-groups-enable-unnamed-formalization":{"title":"I- searchable blobs as unnamed groups enable unnamed formalization","content":"Authored By:: [[P- Brendan Langen]], [[P- Joel Chan]]\n\nIt‚Äôs worth noting how people use analog tools ‚Äì like pen and paper, whiteboards, and maps ‚Äì to structure their thoughts. We‚Äôve mentioned the implicit structure of clustering, and this idea can be carried through as a pattern for pulling together unnamed things into an unnamed, dynamic collection ‚Äì a _blob_.\n\nAnalog spaces enable blobs you don't have to label or name. At these early stages, you don‚Äôt know what form the group will take on. [[C- It is difficult to predict whether structure now will be worthwhile later]]. This enables unnamed formalization of collections of thoughts, which allows for later retrieval that doesn‚Äôt depend on names.\n\nMost current tools require you to label relationships if you want to reuse them in the future. We posit that there users should be able to specify unnamed structure through loose methods.\n\nExceptions are in spatial tools like Miro or Figma. One of our interviewees made a variety of maps in Miro. They were able to look back at a collection of items with a lasso around them and the arrows the collection pointed to, and jump back in quickly.\n\nThis is also seen in most software we‚Äôre familiar with, too. When a new document is created in Google Docs or Obsidian, the file is initially labeled ‚ÄòUntitled (1)‚Äô, and a direct search can later find words within the file. This is to show our familiarity with this frame.\n\nIn our own work, Roam Research allows Joel to construct blobs by chaining things through block references; this linked exploration becomes a trail. Direct search doesn't enable this in most tools. But faceted search, where you can filter and refine your search as you go, allows for blobs to form. This can be created through Roam‚Äôs filters on a page‚Äôs linked references.\n\n[[I- Workspaces as a primitive]] could make sense here.

These unnamed blocks might reference multiple named ideas, but since the author is forming the connections in their head, they have not yet been able to put a name to it.

We can see how this happens with [[C- Newsfeed management can enable users to express their preferences through a combination of revealed preferences and declared preferences|newsfeed management mechanisms]]. As people are looking through the results of a query, they might right click then select the option: \"remove from query.\" The menu path might look like the following, where each of the topics could be toggled:\n\n```clojure\n{:remove {:itemID sladfkji4af4sdkf\n          :author \"John Doe\"\n          :topic-mentioned [\"topic1\"\n                            \"topic2\"]}}\n```\n\nWhen people click on an \"x\" on the query result's item, the [[smart default]] could be to remove that block's UID from the query through `(not (any: uid1 uid2))`.\n\nImagine \"economic inflation\" were a topic mentioned in an item within your newsfeed query and you right clicked to remove that topic. This might translate into the following:\n```clojure\n(def muted-topics-list\n  (any: \"economic inflation\"\n        \"veganism\"))\n(def muted-items-list\n  (any: uid1\n        uid2))\n(def newsfeed\n  (any: followed-people\n        followed-interests)\n  (not: (any: muted-authors-list\n              muted-topics-list\n              muted-items-list)))              \n```\n\nAlternatively, users might process the list of query results through highlighting and lowlighting. [[C- Highlighted and lowlighted search results map to how well results map to intentions]], so the default assumption could be that lowlighting a block would remove that block from the query results. A block id would then have a `queries-where-highlighted` and `queries-where-lowlighted` property, listing the relevant queries.\n\nIt's possible that users don't always want to reify an entirely new query as an entity, and sometimes would like to simply filter a query. Given the compositional nature of the language I'm proposing, it should come as no surprise that we can apply a filter function to any list of query results.\n ```clojure\n(query:\n  newsfeed\n  (any: \"behavioral economics\"\n        \"web3\")\n  (not: \"regulation\"))\n```\n\n[[Roam]] has a GUI for manipulating these filters that can go beyond the language interface described above.

I thought that I couldn't accurately judge it until I did that.\n    -   There's probably still a good amount of stuff that I'm not doing yet, especially stylistically, but they do onboarding through an instruction manual so I think I get it functionally at least.\n    -   Overall, it's cool, but it's just an interesting UX veneer on established concepts. Excerpts is cool though. Really, I just feel as though their main innovation is on stuff that doesn't matter to me.\n    -   The biggest problem is that it's essentially a file system with no good way to cross folder paths. It mixes drawing and personal knowledge management, but I don't think it's great for PKM.\n        -   Each board is both a folder and a file, and you can place boards within boards.\n        -   Each board is only as big as your iPad screen size. You can't zoom in or out at all to fit more information on the board.\n            -   Due to this limitation, if you want a board to contain more contents, you need to make new boards and refactor the information on your current boards into those smaller nested boards.\n                -   **The problem is that this just buries information.** Instead of having everything visible, it requires multiple taps to find what you're looking for.\n                -   Additionally, each board can only exist in one place and there's no way to embed pointers in other areas.\n                    -   For example, I was reading a chapter in a book about experiment design in political psychology:\n                        -   An observation that is reinforced at multiple points is that \"Awareness of being observed can change behavior.\" I have a board with that title. That claim originally came up in the context of me making arguments in a board called \"Against Lab Experiments,\" so it's nested within there.\n                        -   I have another board called \"Field Experiments.\" The book made the argument that a unique strength of field experiments can be that the participants are unaware that they are being observed by researchers. I want to be able to transclude my \"Awareness of being observed can change behavior\" board there so I can play around with those ideas in a different context.\n                        -   All that is allowed to me by Muse is one single path to \"Awareness of being observed can change behavior\" when already there should be two. I have to enter an exact sequence of boards to find the specific one that I'm looking for. I have to organize my boards according to a taxonomy rather than trains of thought.\n                        -   Roam is another Tool for Thought application that has shown possible solutions to these problems.\n                            -   Hyperlinks allow you to cross folder trees.

This allows you to cross folder trees.\n                                    -   In Muse, I would love to be able to \"block reference\" the \"Awareness of being observed can change behavior\" into multiple locations, allowing the idea to proliferate and be discoverable in its appropriate contexts.\n                                        -   These block references would also allow me to nondestructively play with my boards. If each board is making a specific claim, then I want to be able to spread them out like notecards on a table and move them around. If I wanted to do this currently, I would need to remove the board from its original context.\n                                -   You can compare block references to copy paste.

They may prefer to specify relationships implicitly. Yet, if the tool is unable to recognize those relationships, this makes it harder to retrieve relevant materials to think through later, either with yourself or others. In these cases, our tools don‚Äôt let us easily refactor, leading to high friction in reifying our ideas. There also may be an upper limit on the complexity of unintentional structure people can create. \n\nSome thought processors attempt to give their users **structure for free** by implicitly structuring the data from user behavior. These methods promise to make structuring ideas an intrinsic task. For example, outliner tools like Roam and Logseq embed implicit AND/OR relationships between blocks through indentation. Obsidian and other networked notebooks with wikilink autocompletion allow users to name and categorize ideas on the fly. Voiceliner allows you to signify the relative importance of notes by dragging your finger up and down the screen as you record. Jump creates a semantic graph in the background for you and is able to infer relationships and metadata to lighten the user's information entry requirements. \n\nHowever, some users feel restricted by tools that implicitly infer structure from the way that users write because the design is necessarily opinionated. For example, one participant told us that Roam Research was too opinionated when she tried it. You need a course to use it properly and end up indoctrinated into the Roam way of thinking. Her way of thinking is different, so there was a consistent mismatch. In her words, she just wants to inundate her notes with crap but have it all searchable.\n\n Another participant told us that too much inferred structure from his tools slows him down because that would force him to think about structure. For example, Roam derives its structure from indentation and wikilinks. If he had to think about that while he was brainstorming, it would disrupt his flow. He far prefers the agnostic structure of Miro and its infinite canvas because he can \"structure\" by drawing without worrying about if it will fit properly into his \"database\" later.\n\nWe have yet to see affordances for easily structuring unstructured content in hindsight, but we can look to user behavior for ideas to solve this problem. For more, read [[I- Enable composable queries to facilitate structure in hindsight]] and explore its general context, as well as [[I- Replace the backlinks section of a page with a related items section]]. Generally, users can write search expressions that semantically describe what they're looking for, label those searches, and then functionally compose them in order to enable efficient aggregation going forward.\n\nOf course, there are problems of app performance, as well. Certain data structures have proven to be more resilient as scale increases. We won't touch extensively on this topic, but as users want to [[work at the speed of thought]], software that slows us down is a major drawback.\n\nTools for thought performance test at different graph sizes. \n\thttps://www.goedel.io/p/tft-performance-interim-results?r=14n5r4\u0026utm_campaign=post\u0026utm_medium=web\u0026s=r\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:05.996605733Z","tags":null},"/NVivo":{"title":"NVivo","content":"Authored by:: [[P- Brendan Langen]] and [[P- Joel Chan]]\n\nNVivo assists with qualitative data analysis by identifying patterns in data and returning insights to the user.

While there may be agreed-upon schemas under which people operate, it‚Äôs [a challenge to get users to input metadata](https://people.well.com/user/doctorow/metacrap.htm) in a consistent way. These pre-existing structures are implicit metadata ‚Äî the significance of which is revealed through user behavior. For example, the number of times a paper has been cited acts as an implicit measure of support for that particular paper. However, these citation counts miss critical information about whether citing authors supported or opposed the findings, or how claims in the paper play into the area of the discourse graph that authors are to contribute to. If we can identify and understand the rationale behind these agreed-upon structures, we can build upon them in a way that does not feel intrusive to the user and allows them to maximize their potential.\n\nCould the interface to the knowledge graph support positive user behaviors? For example, Twitter's 280-character limit promotes knowledge compression and unqualified hot takes. We first hope to understand how this would impact an individual user, but a more interesting question comes from the potential of this strategy to disrupt how we conceptualize data and iterate on a global knowledge base. The current body of research is [limited by its inability to be queried and updated](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yjTjcIVqttXEA2NXKQ75D8iHGTOxiEj4/view). Nearly every graduate student has completed a review of the literature at some point, but their labor will likely go unrecognized unless it is published by a journal, leaving future researchers to start at the beginning. Can we create a decentralized knowledge graph that encourages synthesis through its design? Can this be developed while still maintaining an individual user‚Äôs privacy?\n\nOur success will be measured by our ability to accurately map out the space, utilize prior research, and understand the techniques and strategies employed by professional knowledge workers and those building tools for thought. We seek to gain an understanding of how implicit metadata already plays a role in these systems, and understand the strategies and searches that underlie these decisions. In the long term, we hope our research will be used in the creation of a collaborative, decentralized knowledge graph.\n\n[[Project success metrics]]","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:06.548603048Z","tags":null},"/Project-Mission-and-Impact":{"title":"Project Mission and Impact","content":"\n**\n\nThrough our research, we plan to generate insights and questions that enable the creation of decentralized tools for networked thought that improve the thinking of all participants. We hope to connect the research and knowledge of academics and practitioners across disciplines and professions, fueling interdisciplinary synthesis the likes of which the world has never seen before. In doing so, we will fight against the trend of technological discourse software that overwhelms us with noise we can't even trust and leaves us fried as we mindlessly scroll through it.\n\nOver the last three years of my (Rob Haisfield) career [in applied behavioral science, I have learned a ton](https://robhaisfield.com/notes/hyper-learning). Most of this learning came from reading papers and working with clients, and it has all gone into my personal notebooks. One of the most important realizations I have had as a practitioner is that the findings from academic research don't always map 1-1 with what works in practice. I have learned the boundary conditions of various theories and synthesized my own through attempting to apply the theory to real life, across multiple situations.\n\nHere's the thing: it's not just me. Every practitioner is learning a lot through their work, connecting the dots. Many of them use a personal knowledge management system in some form or another. Practitioners don't have a proper feedback loop to update the academic knowledge base, and barely even talk to each other. What would happen if we unleash the knowledge of individuals and groups into a decentralized knowledge graph built to facilitate synthesis? How can that technology and behavior be actualized? How can we [[R- Accelerating Scientific Discovery by Lowering Barriers to User-Generated Synthesis of Scientific Literature|lower the barrier to access, contribute, and arrange research?]] What structure can make knowledge graphs interoperable across fields of study and professions, and what will be necessarily domain-specific?\n\nThis is not a new mission. The semantic web has long eluded us, [largely due to problems of human behavior](https://people.well.com/user/doctorow/metacrap.htm). If we are to create a decentralized knowledge graph, we have to figure out a structure that doesn't break if individual people don't manually tag information consistently and honestly. In order for this to work, we need to figure out the right implicit metadata, and in order to do that we need to learn how people interact with knowledge graphs today. What behavioral conventions are necessary to create and maintain a decentralized knowledge graph at different scales so the edges and nodes are composable and able to propagate changes?

Therefore, the scope of the database does not need to be defined in advance and any data that becomes relevant as the application is used can be stored and queried.\n\u003eThe second benefit is that updates and **queries can be posed in a variety of natural language forms**, as is convenient to any user. In contrast, a traditional database query needs to be based on the database schema.\n\u003eA third benefit comes from the fact that the NeuralDB is based on a pre-trained language model that already contains a lot of knowledge.\n\u003eFurthermore, using the same paradigm, we can endow the NeuralDB with more domain knowledge by extending the pre-training corpus to that domain.\n\nThis is best used in domains where knowledge is unclear. \n\nTo compare to other data structures - [[Q- What is the data structure of a graph built to facilitate decentralized knowledge synthesis]] - let's examine relational databases and graph databases. \n\nSince relational databases use predefined structures to store relationships, future changes to schema are more costly than in graph database structures, which store relationships at the individual level. \n\nIn fields where most knowledge is clear, or stable, changes to schema are less necessary. You can design a DB schema up front with greater confidence it will model the field. [[C- Structured writing is a method that can accelerate learning in stable fields]] \n\nIn contrast, if you have to account for changing information - in a field that's being forged, as you say - a graph DB is better because it can define relationships on each individual node. structured writing doesn't work as well in these fields.\n\nFurther, though, might a neural DB be a better model?\n\n\u003e Given its benefits, Neural Databases are well suited for emerging applications where the schema of the data cannot be determined in advance and data can be stated in a wide range of linguistic patterns.\n\nThe example of verifying the correctness of political claims is used, as information is constantly changing. \n\n\u003e Another class of applications is the modeling and querying of political claims [46] (with the goal of verifying their correctness). Here too, claims can be about a huge variety of topics and expressed in many ways. \n\nIt remains to be seen how effective neuralDBs are at updating information over time.\n\n\u003e Finally, another interesting challenge concerns developing semantic knowledge that helps in identifying which updates should replace previous facts and which should not.\n\nChallenges also exist around bias encoded in the model. \n\n\u003e A possible downside of using neural techniques in a database system is the potential for bias that might be encoded in the underlying language model.\n\u003e A possible approach to this important issue is to design a separate module that attacks the database with queries in order to discover hidden biases.

For that, it might prove necessary to segment the queries so certain rules apply to different authors.\n\nThe takeaway to the above solution is that there can be an underlying data structure separate from the visual presentation layer.

Simply being able to see the relationships between nodes of different types, such as \"what questions are attracting the most attention,\" \"what evidence supports this claim,\" and \"which questions lead into other questions,\" will cut through a large amount of noise. [[C- Most scholarly communication infrastructure operates on the document as the base unit]], those documents have non-descriptive titles, and will often make so many points that it is difficult to understand what people are citing in particular when they cite a paper. Graph views of nodes composed of simple keywords are often difficult to interpret, whereas full sentences of claims and questions present the appropriate level of abstraction to understand the relationships between points.\n\nWe should note as well that, if we expect people apart from the author to add metadata and context to the original author's work, they need to be able to do it nondestructively.

This page is here to discuss a critical tradeoff.\n\n## [[The common forms of structure people add to their notes|What forms of structure do we see in thought processors?]]\n\nStructuring information enables a consistent synthesis process, and structure can be seen explicitly and implicitly. During our interviews, we saw people explicitly structure their thoughts in a variety of ways. \n\nAt times, the structure in place was seemingly everywhere.  People showed digital notebooks with a variety of page and block names describing projects and ideas (naming), inline wikilinks to other pages (linking), YAML metadata on each note (attributes), indenting in an outline (explicit relationships), color-coordinated highlights (attributes), detailed file/folder structures (explicit relationships), and block references (explicit relationships).\n\nIn other tools, namely spatial canvases like Figma, Miro, or Kosmik, structure was apparent implicitly.  A lasso drawn around a group of items signified they were to be considered together. A word in larger font above a list of items with smaller size shows significance in a grouped form. A line drawn between two items on the canvas connected the ideas.  This implicit structure was based on layout, type, and references to other items.\n\nYet, in the end, we were surprised to find that people simply don‚Äôt structure their work consistently.  We can think of this \"lack of structure\" as something that lacks formal machine, or even obvious human-readable, classification.  A few examples of this appeared as ‚Äúhalf-baked ideas,‚Äù fuzzy representations in their head or in conversation with others, quick capture notes, informal sketches, or margin notes and highlights.\n\nGiven the choice between structuring now vs. later, people frequently err on the side of having too little structure and rarely, if ever, add structure in hindsight.  We found that this often leaves them without useful artifacts they can build on with others (or their future selves).\n\n## This decision of how, when, and what to structure is a core problem of current thought processors\n\n### [[C- Specifying context for future reuse is costly]]\n\n[[C- Context is necessary for knowledge reuse]], but [[C- Specifying context for future reuse requires predicting trajectories of future reuse]] and [[C- Predicting trajectories of future reuse of information objects is hard]].\n\nAs seen in [[R- Formality Considered Harmful]], four problems arise from formalizing too early in the process. \n\n- Cognitive overhead - [[If I‚Äôm thinking too hard about structure before I write the note, I forget what I was going to write down]], because often the task of formalism is extraneous to the primary task. \n- Tacit knowledge - [[It takes too much work to create structure]] and [[My tooling gets in the way of working at the speed of thought]] \n- Premature structure - [[C- It is difficult to predict whether structure now will be worthwhile later]].

A formalism that excludes speculation, for example, or rough scraps that we don't know what to do with yet, will prematurely kill the creative process.  Some [[People don‚Äôt intentionally review old notes]], or otherwise review notes so rarely that any effort expended on structure upfront would be wasted time.\n- Situational structure - People structure their work in a variety of different ways depending on the people, situation, and task.\n\n## Primary solutions\n\n### 1. Reduce the cost of structuring\n\nPeople tend to prefer just-in-time structuring because specifying context for future reuse is costly, difficult, and has unpredictable benefits. Enabling low-cost structure at the time of writing can help.\n\nWe should be careful as too much structure can inhibit the user's ability to maintain a system. [[C- An increasing amount of structure leads to entropy]], so ideally the system is able to infer a lot of structure from minimal inputs.\n\nNatural language processing can also reduce the user's burden, inferring relationships directly from the user's writing without requiring any special formatting. [[Jump]] is an attempt at this approach. We should note that relying too heavily on a computer's interpretation of natural language may lose some meaning in translation, so it is important to have an [[intermediate interface]] that both the user and the computer understand. Jump does that, but also will ask the user to confirm or reject its inferences.\n\nWe might also gather metadata from the structure of a workspace. If we use [[I- Workspaces as a primitive]], then we might infer that items within the same workspace are related to each other.\n\n[[C- Synthesis tools need to support incremental formalization]] as an additional measure - one example of support might be automatically placing notes on a spaced repetition schedule for review, ensuring that if you don't add all of the structure required at the time of writing, it will resurface at some point for you to add structure later.\n\n### 2. Increase the benefits of structuring.\n\n[[C- Reviewing past notes in the process of creating new notes is a key user behavior to promote synthesis]]. However, [[People don‚Äôt intentionally review old notes]]. Therefore, a promising direction could be to show associated items as you are writing. This is fleshed out in [[C- Designing for ambient review is a rich opportunity space]].\n\n### 3. Enable structure in hindsight\n\n[[I- User-created consistent rules as a primitive]] can help. As we can see in [[I- Enable composable queries to facilitate structure in hindsight]], the user might query for mentions of X or Y, and apply a new tag Z to all results.\n\nThe user might also create rules such as \"if X is indented underneath Y, then the two are related.\" In [[P- Joel Chan]]'s [[Discourse Graph Plugin]], one can even specify relationships such as \"Any evidence note indented underneath a claim note informs the claim.\"\n\nSchema migrations (when the user has a consistent schema for a type of thing, but then they change the schema) are also of crucial importance. Inspiration can be drawn here from object-oriented programming, statically typed programming, and [[Cambria]].","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:06.556603009Z","tags":null},"/Q-Should-social-knowledge-management-be-thought-of-as-social-networks-with-really-solid-defaults-conventions-and-incentives":{"title":"Q- Should social knowledge management be thought of as social networks with really solid defaults conventions and incentives","content":"[[Q- What is the behavior of members of explorer communities]]\n\n[[Q- How is knowledge crystallized and disseminated in discussion oriented explorer communities]]\n\n[[Q- What community roles are necessary in a decentralized knowledge graph]]\n\n[[Q- How do explorer communities grow around software tools]]\n\n[[C- Social networks tend to track social graphs more than knowledge graphs]]\n\nWikipedia editing community is a social network oriented towards impartial consensus.

This is a variant of [[C- In interdisciplinary domains, network-based foraging is more powerful than search-based foraging]]\n-   We have lots of evidence of people being an effective (and in many cases the most preferred) channel to cross-boundary information\n\t-   In describing how scientists at an interdisciplinary center imported information from outside their specialty, [[@palmerWorkBoundariesScience2001]] identified a range of practices, from talking to personal contacts, reading literature, and engaging in more formal learning activities. A strong theme was the special efficiency and effectiveness of talking to people to access and filter cross-boundary information with maximal signal-to-noise ratio.\n\t\t-   For example, Palmer writes, \"no other type of information interaction is likely to be as efficient and profitable as interactive discussions with colleagues\" (p. 33-34)\n\t\t-   She also summarized that scientists at the interdisciplinary research center imported information across disciplinary boundaries predominantly via **personal networks** (pp. 31, 32-35). For example, A device physicist at the center said that the vast majority of their information came from keeping on contact with people and going to conferences\n\t-   There is also research on sources of innovation in innovation contests and firm-/organizational-level innovation that suggests an [[outsider innovation]] phenomenon: breakthrough innovations are more likely to come from people who are technically marginal/distant from the problem domain\n\t\t-   For example, [[@jeppesenMarginalityProblemsolvingEffectiveness2010]] found that Solvers who chose to submit their solutions to the 2nd stage of an innovation contest and self-rated themselves as more technically distant from the problem domain were slightly more likely to submit winning solutions for Innocentive science problem solving contests\n\t-   Additional indirect evidence comes from the literature on collocation and collaboration, which so far we can see generally seems to find facilitative effects on knowledge transfer and collaboration from induced face-to-face contact\n\t\t-   An entry point is [[@cataliniMicrogeographyDirectionInventive2017]], who found substantial changes in the likelihood of collaboration across research labs as a function of collocation, particularly for labs that were \"further apart\" in research areas.\n\t\t\t-   This work *suggests* / is consistent with the idea that other channels of search across boundaries are less efficient than face-to-face (presumably \"small touch\", bc collocation) contact with people from other units (i.e., across boundaries). the logic is that if the search costs were the same / comparable, then those ideas would have initiation probability that is similar to collocation, in the absence of collocation.\n\t\t-   Similarly, [[@boudreauFieldExperimentSearch2017]] found that The likelihood that any given pair of scientists who were assigned to the same breakout room to discuss their work would collaborate on a pilot grant proposal was estimated to be substantially (~75%) higher ($$p(collaborate) ~= .28$$) compared to scientist pairs who were assigned to different rooms ($$p(collaborate) ~= .16$$). This estimated effect was statistically significant at p \u003c .10.\n\t\t\t-   Note, however: this effect seems to be driven by facilitating scientist pairs who are from the same clinical area to collaborate, which suggests there might still be important inefficiencies to accessing and using cross-boundary knowledge, even when you get initial access to it through a person.\n-   We lack evidence that literature discovery tools that don't involve tight integration with at least one person can actually help people cross knowledge boundaries\n-   Why might people be especially efficient access points to cross-boundary information?\n\t-   One explanation might be that [[C- Substantial portions of knowledge that is critical for innovation are not written down]], and are instead \"in the heads\" of people.\n\t\t-   This is partially because [[C- Knowledge is fundamentally contextual]]. It is partially on this basis that [[C- CSCW research on knowledge sharing shifted from a repository model to an expertise sharing model around the mid-2000's]]  [[@ackermanSharingKnowledgeExpertise2013]]\n\t-   Another related explanation could be the oblique nature of analogical inspiration: rather than an idea or a phrase or picture being \"the idea\" that you transfer, it may be more accurate to conceptualize a stimulus, such as an analogous paper as a point/component/spark in a process of inspiration that may lead to a good idea via adapting a direct solution, but also potentially via other routes, such as sparking [[problem (re)formulation]].\n\t\t-   This, combined with the previous point, may mean that encountering a paper from a different domain, no matter how relevant, may be inert in itself, if it isn't connected to a rich process of inspiration (e.g., reformulation, query)\n-   Note that there are still some inefficiencies for the people route\n\t-   For example, [[@laneEngineeringSerendipityWhen]] reported that scientist pairs who were randomly assigned to talk to each other (and did so, face-to-face) at an interdisciplinary medical imaging symposium used about 6 new MeSH keywords from their partners in future publications when the pair had moderate overlap in intellectual interests, compared to low or high overlap (for which there were no clear effects)\n\t\t-   It's notable that the observed positive effects here were for estimated less than 20% of the scientist pairs!\n\t\t-   And in some cases (e.g., when field similarity was high), there were *dampening* effects on co-authorship in the 6 years following the symposium.\n\t\t-   #appraisal - these results seem a bit fragile to me: they rest on interaction terms in relatively complex OLS models.\n\t\t-   Caveats aside, this result suggests that the likelihood that a randomly paired interaction, even within a relatively shared community of interest, and estimating effects on a relatively \"lightweight\" outcome (i.e., evidence of knowledge transfer, instead of more costly endpoints like copublication), is probably less than a coin flip!\n\t-   These results raises the question: [[Q- What is the range of expected \"benefits\" of engineered interactions with potential \"informants\" across knowledge boundaries]]\n\n## Sources\n\n-   collocation / structural holes / networks\n    -   TODO [[@palmerWorkBoundariesScience2001]] Chapter 2\n        -   scientists at the interdisciplinary research center imported information across disciplinary boundaries predominantly via **personal networks** (pp. 31, 32-35).

These models share a common underlying model for representing scientific discourse: they distill traditional forms of publication down into more granular, formalized knowledge **claims**, linked to supporting evidence and **context** through a network or **graph** model. \n\nWe use the term **discourse graph** to refer to this information model, to evoke the core concepts of representing and relating knowledge claims (rather than concepts) as the central unit, and emphasizing linking and relating these claims (rather than categorizing or filing them). Standardizing the representation of scientific claims and evidence in a graph model can support machine reasoning.[^1] We are particularly interested in the [[C- Discourse graphs could significantly accelerate human synthesis work|potential of discourse graphs to accelerate human synthesis work]]. \n\nSo what does it mean for a discourse graph to be decentralized?\n\nSynthesis has many component parts.[^2] Given that, [[C- The responsibilities required to produce synthesis can be split up among many people]]. [[P- Michael Karpeles]] refers to this concept as [human computation](https://twitter.com/mekarpeles/status/1440886235917164546?s=20)\n- Some people will contribute primary research. \n- Some will formalize the research contributed by others into frameworks and theories. [[C- Incrementally processing notes is a key user behavior to promote synthesis]]\n- Some will help determine what directions are meaningful to explore, ranking the utility of the outputs of others.\n- Some will simply read everyone else's outputs and annotate them, all the while meaningfully connecting the conversation between the various fields they explore. [[C- It will be important to capture the potential energy of information consumption]]. \n- Some will rate the contributions of those who annotate to improve the signal to noise ratio. As such, a key question as we go into the interview phase of our research will be: [[Q- What community roles are necessary in a decentralized knowledge graph]]?\n\nDividing the responsibilities of synthesis is one of the core strengths of decentralizing the process. When we look at prior attempts at building a semantic web, we find that the primary reasons have to do with human behavior and dishonesty.\n\n[[C- People are lazy]] and [[C- Most people will primarily consume information]], so we can't expect them to do all of the work necessary to index information themselves. While tools like [[Roam Research]] and [[Obsidian|Obsidian]] enable people to develop advanced discourse graphs for themselves, over time they may end up with a system that is so complicated that maintaining it becomes work. Why not split up the effort so the ones who share information aren't responsible for 100% of the processing?\n\n[^1]: [[R- Genuine semantic publishing]]\n[^2]: [[R- Towards a comprehensive model of the cognitive process and mechanisms of individual sensemaking]]","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:06.556603009Z","tags":null},"/Q-What-is-a-hypertext-notebook":{"title":"Q- What is a hypertext notebook","content":"Authored By:: [[P- Rob Haisfield]]\n\nA hypertext notebook can be thought of as a mini-Wikipedia. It is a deeply entangled web of ideas that are changing constantly. Readers will take a different journey every time they visit, and pages that they have already read may take on new meaning when placed into new contexts.\n\nA key advantage of writing in hypertext is that it allows the writer to express their thinking and research in a way that is simultaneously more in depth and more concise. [[C- Hypertext enables communication with high information density]]. If you have already read a page and internalized its core idea, then all you need to do is see the title of that page to bring to mind the entire argument. At the same time, if something doesn't make sense, you can explore its context by navigating to the ideas that it is built on.\n\nAs such, writing a hypertext notebook is an ideal way to perform a literature review.\n\n[[R- Where the semantic publishing rubber meets the scholarly practice road]]\n\u003e Another example of Explorers‚Äô niche tools is a growing ecosystem of ‚Äúnetworked notebooks‚Äù, which are a particularly interesting category with deep intellectual roots in hypertext [7, 20].

These notes are densely linked to each other (Composability), typically bi directionally: every time a link is made from one source note to a target note, both the source and target notes record the link (see Fig. 5). In this way, links between notes are more accessible, since links can be followed from either source or target notes. This, together with other affordances like autocompletion of links during text editing, enables easier tending to connections between notes (Composability). The links also enable users to compress quite complex ideas into a single statement (e.g., \"knowledge is contextual\") while retaining links to the less compressed ideas that \"unpack different aspects and subtleties of the more complex idea. In this way, tending to the notes and links also enhances the Contextualizability of each entry.\n\u003e Finally, since notes that collect bi-directional links can be as small as a single concept, the act of deliberately linking notes partially accomplishes the work of developing folksonomies (Composability). A key affordance in these networked notebooks is that it is quite easy to renam note titles, with changes automatically propagating throughout the database. This enables more agile and evolving folksonomies.","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:06.556603009Z","tags":null},"/Q-What-is-an-interface-for-going-up-and-down-the-ladder-of-abstraction":{"title":"Q- What is an interface for going up and down the ladder of abstraction","content":"Authored By:: [[P- Rob Haisfield]]\n\nSee how, over the next few minutes, I'm able to **model a thought process** of connecting the generic principles of Roguelikes to the specific context of using flashcards.

Species also vary, and some variations are good and some are bad for survival.

This is why we use the term synthesis instead of the more familiar \"literature review\": in today's conventions, only effective literature reviews are actually synthesis! We think this is [[C- Effective synthesis is necessary for innovation and scientific progress | harmful for scientific progress and innovation]], and are therefore motivated to build new knowledge infrastructures that could make effective synthesis less painful and more commonplace, such as a [[Q- What is a decentralized discourse graph|decentralized discourse graph]].\n\n- Some examples of interdisciplinary synthesis include:\n\t- Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky recognized a claim made by economists that people behaved rationally and questioned it. The rational actor model had long been assumed to be true in economics. They then studied the question through the lens of judgment and decision. Amos Tversky, always the militant debater, would challenge economists to rationalize their findings. This led to the beginning of a new field: **Behavioral Economics**\n\t\t- Much of the discourse in DisciplineA rests on AssumptionA. Participants in the discourse graph for DisciplineB call AssumptionA into question through the evidence and claims of GraphDisciplineB. \n\t\t- In the effort of refuting AssumptionA, they found the areas where DisciplineA and DisciplineB were [[Q- How do we solve the problem of different people referring to the same concept with different language|discussing the same questions with different language.]]\n- [[P- Vitalik Buterin]] et al. recognizing that the blockchain could support full programmability and innovating smart contracts through Ethereum.

They combined many sources of information to solve a problem, emphasizing only the most important bits, where the solutions work together synergistically.\n- Cryptoeconomics is the combination of cryptography and economics for the goal of social coordination towards desirable outcomes. The realization that decentralization needs to come with an incentive layer was a key insight.\n\nSynthesis is necessary for innovation, and as outlined in [[C- Discourse graphs could significantly accelerate human synthesis work]], a decentralized discourse graph can dramatically reduce the work required to achieve synthesis.","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:06.556603009Z","tags":null},"/Q-What-is-the-data-structure-of-a-graph-built-to-facilitate-decentralized-knowledge-synthesis":{"title":"Q- What is the data structure of a graph built to facilitate decentralized knowledge synthesis","content":"Authored By:: [[P- Rob Haisfield]]\n\n- Logical\n\t- Claims\n\t\t- Subquestions\n\t\t- Subclaims\n\t\t- Supporting Evidence\n\t- Problems\n\t\t- Subproblems\n\t\t- Subclaims\n\t\t- Subquestions \n\t- Questions\n\t\t- Subquestions\n\t- Evidence\n\t\t- In academic literature, they will organize papers by their name, journal, authors, and year.

Synthesis is not always within the academic context. Here we see it in product development:\n\nLet's say that I'm trying to figure out the onboarding for a tricky app like GuidedTrack. I need to bring together a ton of potentially conflicting information! User interviews, papers I've read, stakeholder beliefs, emails... By default, this is difficult to synthesize because there is simply too much to read.\n\nA helpful architecture might enable me figure out what the main questions are, find claims related to those questions, follow the evidence supporting and opposing the claims I identify as interesting, and then rearrange those claims to form a fitting answer.\n\nThen, 2 months later when the onboarding plan is built and it does not perform well in usability tests, I would be able to track down the reasoning that led to the incorrect decision, re-evaluate the pillars with new evidence, and finally update the decision.\n\nIn order to facilitate synthesis, the data structure of the discourse graph needs:\n- **Composability.**\n\t- As seen in [[Q- What is synthesis]], people need to compose and remix existing information to form a new whole.\n- **Compression.** \n\t- Compression can be thought of as abstraction. A core thing that abstraction does is remove \"extraneous\" details, retaining only what is \"necessary.\" If one is trying to reuse old thoughts, reading too much information can be overwhelming. \n\t- Compression is about increasing the information density as much as possible. [[P- Andy Matuschak]] recommends using [[I- Search as a primitive|note titles as APIs to the whole idea]].\n- **Context.**\n\t- It can often be difficult to synthesize from the work of others if their thoughts are too compressed because you don't know they really mean. [[C- Compression and contextualizability are in tension]]. Without proper context, it is impossible to know what people base their conclusions on, or why people see some piece of information as important.\n\nFor more challenges awaiting synthesizers, see [[R- Knowledge Synthesis- a conceptual model and practical guide]].\n\nWe certainly do not have all of the answers to this question yet. It will be an active area of discovery over the coming months as we learn more about [[Q- What workflows and behaviors facilitate synthesis]] and [[Q- What user behaviors are people doing already that imply structure that is not being instantiated into a literal structure]].\n\nFor now, we believe a decentralized discourse graph will require support for:\n\n- Blocks of information\n\t- Claims\n\t- Subjective probabilities of truth, with people able to qualify the probabilities they assign\n\t- Boundary conditions\n\t- Questions\n- Inline coding\n\t- This would be able to indicate the logical relationships between blocks and to operate on blocks. End-user programming is crucial, as can be seen in [[I- A DSL for a discourse graph with information entry, visualization, and retrieval]]. \n\t\t- let me write sentences and indicate logical relationships between items. Equals, greater than, follows from, also, is a subcomponent of, etc. Maybe provide a logic for people to define their own relationships through a [parser](app://obsidian.md/parser) like [Instaparse](app://obsidian.md/Instaparse)\n- People\n- Typed Relationships\n\t- Ability to express:\n\t\t- Causality\n\t\t- Opposition or support\n- [[I- Search as a primitive]]\n- Breadcrumbs\n\t- Queues\n[[Standoff Annotation]], as seen in [[Codex OS]], is very appealing as an option.

End-user programming is necessary to self / community governance.\n- https://twitter.com/TauChainOrg/status/1513777139451142146?s=20\u0026t=gVmIRmtS-DT3Cw_pDhf7Aw\n- I asked on Twitter about the conceptual fit between query languages like SQL and Datalog with personal and shared knowledge graphs and they responded.\n- Makes me also think - is there more of a conceptual fit between different types of AI and discourse graphs? I.e. logical AI (Jump, Tau) or probabilistic AI (GPT-3, DALL-E 2)?\n- I would bet that logical AI is a better fit because it's fully explainable. In the context of a discourse graph, you want to know exactly how it built up its answer. Architectural transparency is key.\n- Also, a logical AI might be able to do more from the relatively small amount of data produced by individual researchers in their own graphs. From our interviews, people seem to want AI that is tuned to their personal knowledge graphs, not necessarily from a global body of knowledge.\n- On the other hand, a probabilistic AI might be a better fit if you consider the \"zettelkasten as a conversation partner\" to be most important.\n- Additionally, with the discourse graph generated by thousands or millions of participants, idk which would be more effective - a probabilistic or logical AI.\n- I know a guy who has built a library (can't find it) called Frankenstein that is trained to look at black box probabilistic AI results and fabricate propositional logic explanations. Spitballing, a cool model might be:\n\t- Probabilistic AI to identify logical relationships from natural language\n\t- Logical AI built on top of that\n\t- Probabilistic AI to answer questions from a global discourse graph\n\t- Frankenstein to interpret those answers in terms of logical relationships and check to see if they are correct or where they might have logical breakdowns\n\nThoughts from [[P- Ryan Murphy]]:\n\nIn language processing/AI-ish stuff, I want to see:\n\u003e [[P- Ryan Murphy]]:\n\u003e - Find similar/related documents (as per DEVONthink) \n\u003e - Identify missing links (e.g., highlight important words/tokens that seem to appear significant and relevant elsewhere in your notes, too) \n\u003e - Suggested tags ...

Given that, it makes sense that the responsibilities required to produce synthesis can be split up among many people. This is one of the key strengths of decentralized applications.\n\nWith this question, we aim to learn how people synthesize information. Answering this will inform the creation of data structures and functionality that facilitate synthesis in a decentralized way. If we want the default outcome of participating in this discourse graph to be synthesis, the data structure should support people in going through the process. After all, it is generally easier to facilitate closing the intention-behavior gap than it is to motivate an entirely new intention.\n\nThis is the primary question we will be exploring over the course of the [[Interview Guide|user interviews]].\n\nFrom our exploration, we have a few starting points. \n\n- [[Search Behavior]]\n\t- People need to find information when they aren't quite sure what they are looking for or how to articulate what they are looking for. Before you have solved a problem or articulated the right framing for a it, focused search is not sufficient.\n- Tidying/Gardening\n\t- As people review their content, they make small changes and updates. This helps to ensure [[Q- How might we propagate changing beliefs throughout a network|changing beliefs are propagated throughout the system]]. \n\t\t- See [this interview](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/q-a-dissecting-the-development-of-i-dwarf-fortress-i-with-creator-tarn-adams) with Tarn Adams: ![[Pasted image 20211118174735.png]]\n- Braindump\n\t- People will dump all of their thoughts onto a page in order to figure out what they want to say. At this point, they need to work with a data structure that is fast and does not get in the way. [[C- Some users feel restricted by tools for thought with overly strict data structures]]. However, we must consider [[Q- How might we navigate the structure now or later tradeoffs|the structure now vs. later tradeoff]] here, where they braindump so many ideas that it becomes hard to work with in the future. This is perhaps where there is an opportunity to support [[C- Incrementally processing notes is a key user behavior to promote synthesis|incremental processing]], as [[C- Loosely structured notes are not a useful knowledge artifact for others]].\n\t- It is often the case that people will go through multiple stages of braindumping in succession. [[C- People will iterate and rewrite the same ideas in order to crystallize their thoughts]].\n- Sensemaking behavior\n\t- See [[C- Synthesis as a process is usefully modeled as a specialized form of sensemaking]], where we discuss how there are two primary loops: foraging (finding information) and sensemaking. For the interviews, we are primarily interested in sensemaking, as there are more pre-established design patterns for foraging.\n\t- Designers [[Q- What workflows and behaviors facilitate synthesis|will often]] use [affinity diagrams](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/affinity-diagram/), and we see variations of this in other fields, where people will collect many thoughts and then attempt to chunk them together into meaningful groups.\n\t- - How and why [---] and existing implementations (sub in each of the bullet points below for the blank space between brackets, as though [---] represented a variable)\n\t\t- people compose, compress, and expand information\n\t\t- people reuse information / interpretations\n\t\t- people prioritize information / interpretations\n\t\t- people connect information / interpretations\n\t- Progression through stages\n\t\t- People like to move ideas through stages. From seedlings to evergreen notes, from premise to draft, from draft to deliverable. When an idea has moved through all of those stages, they end up with [[Multiplicity]], where they have referred to similar concepts in many different ways. While they don't want to delete it all, they do want the canonical, published version to be what they refer to. [[C- People want to maintain multiple copies or iterations of the same information while recognizing contextual canon]].\n\t\t- Some people will write and rewrite their ideas multiple times in order to crystallize their thoughts. There is a big opportunity in supporting the process of rewriting ideas and identifying the themes that are consistent across iterations.\n\t- Prioritization\n\t\t- When people have many tasks or idea premises, they need to be able to sift through all of them and prioritize/signal which are the most important. One way to do that is by marking a note as worthy of progressing to the next stage. [[Knovigator]] does it instead by enabling quadratic voting on individual notes.\n\nAny work that we hook into for them to author a discourse graph should line up with workflows that help them. People like putting ideas into clusters. We want to hook into in progress work. People take courses, download exercise apps, etc. because they want to change but are struggling to do it on their own. \n\n[[P- Ryan Singer]] instantiates his brainstorming and planning workflow in the video here.\n\n{{\u003c tweet user=\"rjs\" id=\"1434934749731098630\" \u003e}}","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:06.556603009Z","tags":null},"/Q-Why-do-people-prefer-to-structure-later-or-not-at-all":{"title":"Q- Why do people prefer to structure later or not at all","content":"This page can be thought of as a contextual index page - so point to other pages while discussing how that's relevant to the common forms of structure people add to their notes.

Unfortunately, more knowledge does not necessarily lead to more understanding. Our methods for sharing knowledge are collapsing under the weight of distrust of science and journalism, false beliefs, misinformation campaigns, and deliberate fraud ‚Äînot to mention the sheer quantity of information. Think of how overwhelming it would be to read everything that has been said on a given topic, much less decide what of it is true. Fortunately, the information technologies that helped create these problems may also help us solve them. Eventually, intelligent software will enable us to filter, judge, and connect all public information. Here, we describe how we are making this possible by sharing public assertions of knowledge in a form that can be more readily processed by such software. \n\n- ==[[Q- What user behavior is required to grow a decentralized discourse graph|Sharing human knowledge involves]] selecting what is important, analyzing what is true, vetting the reliability of the source, and presenting the information in a form that is intelligible to the intended audience.== In traditional media, such as textbooks and scientific papers, all of this work is done in advance of publication, and there is no method for adapting to new knowledge or new contexts. In contrast, consider technology-enabled _**dynamic presentation**_, which continuously filters and updates knowledge. For example, while you are driving, a dynamic map makes you aware of changing traffic conditions and suggests alternate routes based on your priorities; this software is already in use. Now imagine how dynamic presentations could change publishing in science, education, or journalism. A scientific paper could reflect the latest experimental evidence. A textbook could adapt to the language, interests and reading level of the student. A news article could reflect the latest developments and filter out information that is no longer credible.\n\t- [[Q- How might we propagate changing beliefs throughout a network]]? Obvious answer is we use [[GraphQL]] queries for live updating data\n\n- \u003e ==To enable this kind dynamic presentation of all knowledge, we propose the creation of an open, machine-readable collection of all public knowledge ‚Äî including science, law, commerce, news ‚Äî called the _**Underlay**_.== The Underlay will gather knowledge currently used to produce publications, databases, and dynamically generated displays. It will make each associated assertion available in a machine-readable form that can be dynamically searched, vetted, and combined, based on its provenance. ==By connecting multiple sources together, each asserted claim can be analyzed for relevance and veracity, recombined and re-presented for different purposes. The Underlay will allow intelligent software to help people find what is relevant and judge what is true.==\n\t\t- [[C- Composability facilitates synthesis]]\n\n**The Underlay Project** \n\n==The creation of richer collections of machine-readable knowledge is inevitable. What is not inevitable is that such knowledge will be connected in a meaningful way and be freely available as a public resource.== We are at a fork in the road. The transition to machine-mediated access¬† could consolidate our dependence on a few large commercial intermediaries, or alternatively, it could be built as open infrastructure, as a public good.¬†\n\nJust as it took decades of work to weave the World Wide Web, building the Underlay will be a massive worldwide effort. Like the web, it will be built primarily by those who connect their information to the shared system for their own purposes. Our initial effort is focused on building what is required to enable that.¬†\n\n- ==This work is underway at MIT‚Äôs not-for-profit Knowledge Futures Group (KFG), with collaboration and funding by grants from individuals, foundations, and commercial partners.== We have already solved many conceptual problems related to the Underlay, such as:¬†\n\t-   how to represent complex assertions\n\t-   how to represent the Underlay in a way that is independent of human language\n\t-   [[Q- Can the blockchain be used to improve citation chains|how to indicate and verify provenance]]\n\t-   how to recognize when separate sources are making assertions about the same entity\n\t-   the technical architecture required to store and disseminate the Underlay\n\t-   how to protect the Underlay from damage by imposters, spammers and other bad actors¬†\n\n\nWe are now just beginning to build the software tools that implements these ideas. We plan to test and refine these tools by applying them to use cases in a few specific areas of knowledge, such as scientific information about COVID-19, that are of interest to our early sponsors. Fields of coverage will expand over time, eventually linking many topics and formats of published knowledge. Our goal is to build a sound framework that can grow to a distributed, industrial-scale effort.¬†\n\n**How the Underlay works** \n\n- ==The Underlay is not truth, but assertions of truths attributed to their source. For example, the assertion ‚Äú_Nur-Sultan is the capital of Kazakhstan,_‚Äù might be linked to the provenance: ‚Äúfrom _Version 2011.1 of the UN Membership database_._.._‚Äù The provenance would also describe when and how the database was extracted and recorded into the Underlay. All assertions and provenances would be stored in easy-to-process machine-readable form, and through chains of relationships, interconnected into a web of knowledge.¬†== \n\t- [[Q- What is the data structure of a graph built to facilitate decentralized knowledge synthesis]]\n\n- \u003e Assertions in the Underlay are _**relationships**_ between _**entities**_. In the example, _Kazakhstan_ and _Nur-Sultan_ are entities, and _is-the-capital-of_ is a relationship[[RDF Triplets|+]]. Entities may be anything worth knowing about, real or fictional, permanent or ephemeral, current or historical. Assertions may be anything that can be said about them. The relationship _written-by_ might link an author and a book; _location_ might link a mountaintop to its geo-coordinates. ==Assertions may have other assertions made about them, such as opinions on their veracity, or limitations on their scope. For example, someone can assert that the example assertion about _Nur-Sultan ‚Äúbecame-true_‚Äù in 1997_._ And such assertions about assertions have provenances of their own. This uniform representation helps software to search and evaluate the Underlay‚Äôs web of knowledge.¬†\n\t\t- I'm really curious how this could relate to [[Hode]], where you can also have assertions about assertions to form higher order relationships.\n\t\t- The became-true relationship with a date type value is really interesting as a way to respond to: [[Q- How might we propagate changing beliefs throughout a network]]\n\n- \u003e ==Sometimes sources contradict one another. Comedian Gracie Allen claimed her birth year was 1906, but the US Census listed it as 1895. The Underlay will contain both assertions with their provenance, leaving it to other processes to decide which to trust.== It will also include assertions by others about the credibility of these alternate versions of the truth. Algorithms will use endorsements from organizations such as Merriam-Webster, the Wikimedia Foundation, and scientific journals, to judge what is true.¬†\n\t- [[Q- How do we make a data structure that can be queried through GraphQL]]? Does this assertion style work, or does it have to be a standard schema? Would we have to create certain sorts of assertions?\n\n- \u003e ==Assertions may be added to the Underlay by anyone; those who add an assertion are noted as part of its provenance. The Underlay allows additions, not edits, so that many copies (or partial copies with different subsets of knowledge) can exist simultaneously.== The Underlay may be used in many places at once, online and offline. It can be stored in a distributed network of registries, each storing different parts. No registry is required to store the entire Underlay, or to accept every new assertion.\n\t- [[comment]] Perhaps people could \"back\" the assertions of others, or there could be some sort of consensus mechanism for bringing multiple assertions together or [[F- Wikum allows you to summarize groups of comments on a Hacker News style forum|summarizing multiple assertions]]. We ask [[Q- What is the role of reputation in a global knowledge graph]], and perhaps that goes into the consensus mechanism. When asking [[Q- What community roles are necessary in a decentralized knowledge graph]], this is a rich source of inspiration.\n\nAny assertion can be updated or contradicted, perhaps even by the same source, but the updates will have different timestamps. [[Q- What does multiplayer look like with immutable state|Some registries may choose to stop storing an assertion while others retain it.]] ==Some will make an assertion about a statement‚Äôs veracity or value. Others will take these judgments into account in deciding what to store. This leads to many independent editorial judgments of what to believe and what to store. Consensus is not required, and not even expected.==¬†\n\n**How the Underlay is different from other public knowledge bases** \n\nOne way to understand the Underlay is to compare it to other open collections of knowledge.¬†\n\n_**Wikipedia**_ is a set of public knowledge about notable entities presented in an illustrated natural language format. Distinct versions of Wikipedia exist in different languages. It may be the most widely used reference publication ever created. Much of its knowledge is not yet easily interpretable by machines. Articles contain structured elements, including categories and often an ‚Äúinformation box‚Äù with roughly standardized fields. As in the Underlay, additions can be asserted by anyone. A prefilter for ‚Äúnotable‚Äù topics limits what is included in most language editions. Knowledge is attributed, usually to pseudonymous editors, and cited to a source roughly once a paragraph. ==What makes Wikipedia different than the Underlay is that its assertions are not machine-readable, and it covers only a few million topics, making it tiny by comparison with commercial knowledge graphs.==\n\n==Public databases such as the _**U.S. patent database**, **SEC filings**, **citation indexes**, **catalogs**, the **human genome**_, star atlases, linguistic lexicons, and zoological taxonomies are usually machine- readable, but not stored in any consistent format. Some, like the _**Allen Brain Atlas**_, are actively maintained, expanded, and made available for the public good.== The Underlay would both take advantage of these open efforts and expand their usefulness by making the knowledge within them available in a common format and connecting them with other types of knowledge.¬†\n\n==_**Blockchains**_ are distributed public ledgers of assertions. Like the Underlay, they are distributed, with no storage node having special status. Their primary purpose is to ensure agreement among users about what transactions took place between them, which is not a requirement of the Underlay. **Blockchains may have a role in implementing the Underlay, but because they have no¬†standard representation of knowledge and are difficult to scale, they are not in themselves a solution to the problem of sharing public knowledge.**¬†==\n\nSeveral projects have tried to represent vetted general knowledge in an open machine-readable format, such as _**DBpedia**_ and _**Opencyc.**_ These databases differ from the Underlay in attempting a consistent version of the truth, rather than all (possibly contradicting) assertions and their provenance. ==These are an excellent source of assertions for the Underlay, and the Underlay may be a source of provenance and reliability data for these vetted collections, as it stores attributed assertions about the validity of other assertions. Such curated databases could be represented as sources in the Underlay.¬†==\n\n==The public databases most similar to the Underlay are _**Freebase**_ and _**Wikidata**_, open entity-relationship databases with limited provenance. Like the Underlay, each preserves the history of assertions; sourced assertions can come from anyone; they can contradict other assertions; and relationships are language-independent.== (The recent launch of **Abstract Wikipedia** may improve further on the latter.) Both have assertions added by curators around the world. Like the Underlay, they include assertions automatically extracted from other published sources. They have some representation of authorship, although not as rich a representation of provenance as that envisioned for the Underlay.¬†\n\n==Freebase and its toolchain was acquired by Google and used to build what is now the _**Google Knowledge Graph**_. At the time Freebase was acquired, it had about 100 million assertions, many of which have now become part of Wikidata. The Google Knowledge Graph has grown steadily since then, adding other public and private data, now fully intermixed so that none of these updates are available to the public.== Today it has hundreds of billions of assertions, and is used widely for search, advertisement placement, generating dynamic presentations, and much more. It is the knowledge base that is most similar to the envisioned Underlay, except for the important difference that it is managed as a proprietary resource, rather than as a public good. The Underlay also supports richer presentations of provenance and improved methods of connecting independent collections of knowledge.¬†\n\n**Summary** \n\nThe Underlay is a long-term global project. It has the potential to become part of humanity‚Äôs basic infrastructure, enabling wider and more useful access to public knowledge. Eventually, if we are successful, it may change how we discover and understand what is known.¬†\n\n_For the original whitepaper, see: [The Future of Knowledge](https://www.underlay.org/pub/future/)_\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:06.556603009Z","tags":null},"/R-A-Troubleshooters-Checklist-for-Prospective-Authors":{"title":"R- A Troubleshooters Checklist for Prospective Authors","content":"\n-   #references\n    -   Title: A Troubleshooter's Checklist for Prospective Authors Derived from Reviewers' Critical Feedback\n    -   Meta:\n        -   Tags: #ref/Paper\n        -   Authored by:: Adrienne Alton-Lee\n        -   Year: [[1998]]\n        -   Publication: Teaching and Teacher Education\n        -   URL:\n        -   Citekey: alton-leeTroubleshooterChecklistProspective1998\n    -   Content\n        -   Placeholder\n        -   Abstract\n            -   Presents, in order of frequency of occurrence, critical comments apparent in multiple reviews of 58 manuscripts received from April 1997 to April 1998 by Teaching and Teacher Education, thus identifying the breaches of canon most frequently identified in reviewers' critical comments.

Jones, 2009, \"Burden of knowledge\"\n\n\u003e The fundamental information models that underlie most scientists' everyday reading and communication practices are not readily amenable to integration, comparison, sharing, and translation across publications, researchers, or domains\n\nSynthesis is arduous and effortful. A significant amount of labor goes towards transforming raw unstructured texts into forms amenable to publication. \n\n\u003e The experience of synthesis work is often described as arduous and effortful (Ervin, 2008, Knight et al., 2019, Granello, 2001,) and estimates of the time taken to do synthesis in a rigorous manner, such as in a systematic review, corroborate these subjective experiences (Shojania et al., 2007, Petrosino, 1999, Ervin, 2008), with the labor of transforming the \"raw data\" of unstructured texts into forms amenable for analysis comprising a major portion of these time costs.\n\n\u003e One effort to address the difficulty of synthesis is a growing body of work on tools for augmenting systematic review work [O‚ÄôConnor et al., 2019]. While promising, these efforts are often framed as special-purpose tools disconnected from (and not interoperable with) routine scientific practices [O‚ÄôConnor et al., 2019].\n\nThis reminds me of how [Abstract](https://www.abstract.com/) struggled because [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) was pretty far outside of designer workflows\n\nOne of Joel's main goals is to lower the barrier for scientists to efficiently generate synthesis and incorporate it into their routine practices.

Are there conflicting theoretical predictions that might signal fruitful areas of inquiry? What are the key phenomena to keep in mind when designing an intervention (e.g., perceptions of human vs. automated action, procedural considerations, noise in judgments of wrongdoing, scale considerations for spread of harm)? What intervention patterns (whether technical, behavioral, or institutional) have been proposed that are both a) judged on theoretical and circumstantial grounds as likely to be effective in this setting, and b) lacking in direct evidence for efficacy?\nThese sorts of questions and claims help you actually map knowledge better\n\nYou need contextual details in order to understand how domain-general knowledge applies to domain-specific knowledge. [[Q- How do you handle the transition from private to public without sacrificing context and privacy]]\n\nDiscourse graphs allow for greater reuse and repurposing of synthesis over time by compressing knowledge into usable claims.\n\n\u003e In a discourse graph, claims have many-to-many relationships to support composition of more complex arguments and theories, or \"decompression\" into component supporting/opposing claims.\n\nI don't know if decompression is the right word or better, \"expansion\"\n\nHis model has synthesis claims, questions, context, and observations.

One activity that consumes much of a scientist's time is developing models that balance contradictory and redundant evidence. Driven by our desire to understand the information behaviors of this important user group, and the behaviors of scientific discovery in general, we conducted an observational study of academic research scientists as they resolved different experimental results reported in the biomedical literature. This article is the first of two that reports our findings. In this article, we introduce the Collaborative Information Synthesis (CIS) model that reflects the salient information behaviors that we observed. The CIS model emerges from a rich collection of qualitative data including interviews, electronic recordings of meetings, meeting minutes, e-mail communications, and extraction worksheets. Our findings suggest that scientists provide two information constructs: a hypothesis projection and context information. They also engage in four critical tasks: retrieval, extraction, verification, and analysis. The findings also suggest that science is not an individual but rather a collaborative activity and that scientists use the results of one analysis to inform new analyses. In Part 2, we compare and contrast existing information and cognitive models that have inadvertently reported synthesis, and then provide five recommendations that will enable designers to build information systems that support the important synthesis activity.\n- lit-context\n\t- won #BestPaper at [JASIST]\n\t- followed up by [[R- Collaborative information synthesis II]]\n- lit-notes\n\t- two main information artifact types: 1) hypothesis projection, and 2) context information\n\t- is an #example-of how [context] is critical for synthesis (in this case, showing the kinds of [context queries] scientists look for to try to do [synthesis] over contradictory findings in a [systematic review]\n\t\t- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FHMQH8rqkuk.png?alt=media\u0026token=037f6d7e-f1e4-4738-a841-58923bbacadc) (p. 1744)\n\t\t- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F1iSPHVlrcS.png?alt=media\u0026token=5700d1f3-6c77-4b9a-a51c-bc083004ae33) (p. 1744) \n\t- some types of [context] information were more contextual, depending on the particular \"hypothesis projection\" of the review, which varied across the lifecycle of the project studied (e.g., location of medical condition, amount of exposure, confounding risk factors), while others were more constant regardless of hypothesis (e.g., study- and population-context information)\n\t\t- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FB4elpsPH17.png?alt=media\u0026token=afbe16b6-a3e6-478f-9929-95c520444ad3) (p., 1744) \n\t\t- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FHMQH8rqkuk.png?alt=media\u0026token=037f6d7e-f1e4-4738-a841-58923bbacadc) (p. 1744)\n\t- authors think that there is enough regularity in the types and locations of [context] information that we could build an automated system to extract htese bits of information, which would in turn enable exploration of a variety of hypothesis projections\n\t\t- in other words: [[Z: Contextualizability is necessary for synthesis]] :)\n\t\t- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F_KER50Xs10.png?alt=media\u0026token=b19c8f59-7da5-4ccd-bcb5-4e7f2f7f2f49) (p. 1744)\n\t- director of the public health group estimated that she spent ~3 hrs per article to extract [context] information required  for a particular [systematic review]\n\t\t- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FbDAZcjYk1P.png?alt=media\u0026token=5758ef30-d816-4a53-82c0-b32abc55e667) (p. 1746)\n\t\t- this is self-reported estimate: based on work on knowledge work estimation (cc. also [[R- The Cost Structure of Sensemaking]]), could well be an underestimate, though unclear by how much","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:06.556603009Z","tags":null},"/R-Constraint-relaxation-and-chunk-decomposition-in-insight-problem-solving":{"title":"R- Constraint relaxation and chunk decomposition in insight problem solving","content":"- #[[references]]\n    - Title: Constraint relaxation and chunk decomposition in insight problem solving\n    - Meta:\n        - Authored by:: [[G.

These 2 mechanisms generate specific predictions about the relative difficulty of individual problems and about differential transfer effects.== The predictions were tested in 4 experiments using matchstick arithmetic problems. The results were consistent with the predictions. Representational change is a more powerful explanation for insight than alternative hypotheses, if the hypothesized change processes are specified in detail. Overcoming impasses in insight is a special case of the general need to override the imperatives of past experience in the face of novel conditions.\n- #references\n    - Title: Constraint relaxation and chunk decomposition in insight problem solving\n    - Meta\n        - Tags: [[D/Solution-Diversity]] [[D/Synthesis Infrastructure]] [[D/Computational Analogy]]\n        - Authored by::  [[Gunther Knoblich]] ,  [[Stellan Ohlsson]] ,  H.

We have investigated the classification of technical documentations in two engineering domains: a steel mill and a sewerage plant company. In both cases we found a coexistence of different classification schemes and problems resulting from distributed local archives. In supporting human actors to maintain different classifications schemes while working on a common archive, we developed the concept of context grabbing. It allows assigning context information efficiently in the form of metadata. Based on a document management system, a tool kit for context grabbing was developed. Its evaluation in a sewerage service company allows us to comment on important aspects of understanding the role of classifications in collaborative work.\n        - #context-snippets\n            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FYhHuwMz8Tp.png?alt=media\u0026token=acf224fa-df96-4689-9ec0-abe2881f1cd9)\n            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FpX4rNj7Qga.png?alt=media\u0026token=5919f57c-dac8-4bea-b75d-078a1629bd61)\n                - pg 372\n            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FJ2Sqr7nsSy.png?alt=media\u0026token=a5f60919-328e-43b9-8b79-d9043f2ba5d8)\n            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F7zrr6dqDHb.png?alt=media\u0026token=b9d89e5a-f88c-473c-a7e3-04e6e0cac621)\n    - #lit-context\n        - [[ECSCW]] is where a lot of the [[m/Ethnography]] in context of **Work** is still alive (exited somewhat from [[CSCW]]), so we can have a bit more confidence that this is done well from a theoretical and methodological perspective\n        - last author [[Wendy Mackay]] is super-prominent in [[CSCW]]\n            - ex: chosen to summarize history of social comptuing research in the 1980's at the 2020 CSCW conference panel\n    - #[[üìù lit-notes]]\n        - useful precursor to idea of [[flexible compression]] as means for tackling [[C- Specifying context for future reuse is costly]]\n    - #lit-context\n    - #[[üìù lit-notes]]\n        - **How did the authors approach their questions/problems?** ((most of this is going to come from the methods sections, although some info about conceptualization of key concepts might be relevant to pull from intro/lit-review)) #lit-context\n        - **What did they find?** ((keep this as contextualized as possible; resist the urge to repeat claims or generalizations)) #[[observation-notes]]\n            - Decentralized project documentation made recontextualization difficult for engineers because they didn't know the history of changes for a document or if a particular document was up to date, leading to issues such as \"exploratory digging by hand\" to avoid damaging power lines pg 375\n                - [[P- Joel Chan]] comments\n                    - this is looking pretty good in terms of granularity, i can work with this!\n                    - would be nice to know more about what is meant by decentralized project documentation. \n                        - probably best to have a separate `observation note` block that summarizes that (with its own `context snippets`), and the block ref that into the \"decentralized project documentation\".

These datasets do not yet exist, and if they did we would have no way of evaluating whether or not the algorithmically-generated insights were sufficient or even correct. To address this, here we take a classical microprocessor as a model organism, and use our ability to perform arbitrary experiments on it to see if popular data analysis methods from neuroscience can elucidate the way it processes information. Microprocessors are among those artificial information processing systems that are both complex and that we understand at all levels, from the overall logical flow, via logical gates, to the dynamics of transistors. We show that the approaches reveal interesting structure in the data but do not meaningfully describe the hierarchy of information processing in the microprocessor. This suggests current analytic approaches in neuroscience may fall short of producing meaningful understanding of neural systems, regardless of the amount of data. Additionally, we argue for scientists using complex non-linear dynamical systems with known ground truth, such as the microprocessor as a validation platform for time-series and structure discovery methods.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:06.556603009Z","tags":null},"/R-Darwin-on-man-A-psychological-study-of-scientific-creativity":{"title":"R- Darwin on man A psychological study of scientific creativity","content":"\n-   Title: Darwin on man: A psychological study of scientific creativity\n-   Meta:\n    -   Tags:: #R-Book #[[references]] #synthesis\n    -   Authored by:: [[Howard E.

The differences between traditional cognitive views and the socio-cognitive or domain-analytic view are outlined. It is claimed that, given elementary skills in computer-based retrieval, people are basically interacting with representations of subject literatures in IR. The kind of knowledge needed to interact with representations of subject literatures is discussed. It is shown how different approaches or ‚Äúparadigms‚Äù in the represented literature imply different information needs and relevance criteria (which users typically cannot express very well, which is why IS cannot primarily rely on user studies). These principles are exemplified by comparing behaviorism, cognitivism, psychoanalysis, and neuroscience as approaches in psychology. The relevance criteria implicit in each position are outlined, and empirical data are provided to prove the theoretical claims. It is further shown that the most general level of relevance criteria is implied by epistemological theories. The article concludes that the fundamental problems of IS and IR are based in epistemology, which therefore becomes the most important allied field for IS.\n    - #lit-context\n        - Seems classic (475 cites on GS, plus part of line of work around domain analysis) [[Domain-Analysis]] approach\n            - Author also seems super important in this space\n    - #[[üìù lit-notes]]\n        - Disciplines have deep-rooted and consequential differences in what counts as \"relevant\" information.

Given the advent of better computer support for reading and annotation, including tablet interfaces, will people ever share their personal digital ink annotations as is, or will they make substantial changes to them? What can we do to anticipate and support the transition from personal to public annotations? To investigate these questions, we performed a study to characterize and compare students' personal annotations as they read assigned papers with those they shared with each other using an online system. By analyzing over 1, 700 annotations, we confirmed three hypotheses: (1) only a small fraction of annotations made while reading are directly related to those shared in discussion; (2) some types of annotations - those that consist of anchors in the text coupled with margin notes - are more apt to be the basis of public commentary than other types of annotations; and (3) personal annotations undergo dramatic changes when they are shared in discussion, both in content and in how they are anchored to the source document. We then use these findings to explore ways to support the transition from personal to public annotations.\n    - #lit-context\n        - #canonical cite in our lab on annotations\n    - #[[üìù lit-notes]]\n        - Types of [[annotation]]s p.351\n            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F_UKK-Yjrcn?alt=media\u0026token=79854c40-f7a2-4673-be57-642006212805)\n        - Most (~70-80%) private [[annotation]]s are not useful to other people (p. 354)\n            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FP8xVLNi95c?alt=media\u0026token=c43ee13b-f30e-4b33-a701-4c4a7be09eee)\n        - People frequently need to make substantial changes to [[annotation]]s ot make them useful to other people (p. 354)\n            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F4p3Us2Yrvg?alt=media\u0026token=b0954b0f-7664-4125-b109-3fb4f5693955)\n            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FIoe9FwtYc9?alt=media\u0026token=70d1b6c7-634d-452d-84a1-297eb1e59783)\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:06.556603009Z","tags":null},"/R-Face-Masks-Against-COVID-19":{"title":"R- Face Masks Against COVID-19","content":"\n-   #[[references]]\n    -   Title: Face Masks Against COVID-19: An Evidence Review\n    -   Meta:\n        -   Authored by:: [[Jeremy Howard]] [[Austin Huang]] [[Zhiyuan Li]] [[Zeynep Tufekci]] [[Vladimir Zdimal]] [[Helene-Mari van der Westhuizen]] [[Arne von Delft]] [[Amy Price]] [[Lex Fridman]] [[Lei-Han Tang]] [[Viola Tang]] [[Gregory L.

Face Masks Against COVID-19: An Evidence Review. undefined](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202004.0203/v3)\n    -   Content\n        -   Abstract\n            -   The science around the use of masks by the general public to impede COVID-19 transmission is advancing rapidly. Policymakers need guidance on how masks should be used by the general population to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. In this narrative review, we develop an analytical framework to examine mask usage, considering and synthesizing the relevant literature to inform multiple areas: population impact; transmission characteristics; source control; PPE; sociological considerations; and implementation considerations. A primary route of transmission of COVID-19 is via respiratory droplets, and is known to be transmissible from presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Reducing disease spread requires two things: first, limit contacts of infected individuals via physical distancing and other measures, and second, reduce the transmission probability per contact. The preponderance of evidence indicates that mask wearing reduces the transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected droplets in both laboratory and clinical contexts. Public mask wearing is most effective at reducing spread of the virus when compliance is high. The decreased transmissibility could substantially reduce the death toll and economic impact while the cost of the intervention is low. Given the current shortages of medical masks we recommend the adoption of public cloth mask wearing, as an effective form of source control, in conjunction with existing hygiene, distancing, and contact tracing strategies. Because many respiratory droplets become smaller due to evaporation, we recommend increasing focus on a previously overlooked aspect of mask usage: mask-wearing by infectious people (\"source control\") with benefits at the population-level, rather than mask-wearing by susceptible people, such as health-care workers, with focus on individual outcomes. We recommend that public officials and governments strongly encourage the use of widespread face masks in public, including the use of appropriate regulation.\n        -   #quotes\n            -   The standard RCT paradigm is well-suited to medical interventions in which a treatment has a measurable effect at the individual level and furthermore, interventions and their outcomes are independent across persons comprising a target population.\n            -   By contrast, the effect of masks on a pandemic is a population-level outcome where individual-level interventions have an aggregate effect on their community as a system. Consider, for instance, the impact of source control ‚Äî its effect occurs to other individuals in the population, not the individual who implements the intervention by wearing a mask. This also underlies a common source of confusion ‚Äî most RCT studies in the field examine masks as personal protective equipment (PPE) because efficacy can be measured in individuals to whom treatment is applied, i.e. ‚Äúdid the mask protect the person who wore it?‚Äù Even then, ethical issues prevent the availability of an unmasked control arm (27). The lack of direct causal identifiability requires a more integrative systems view of efficacy.\n            -   We need to consider first principles ‚Äî transmission properties of the disease, controlled biophysical characterizations alongside observational data, partially informative RCTs (primarily with respect to PPE), natural experiments (28), and policy implementation considerations ‚Äî a discursive synthesis of interdisciplinary lines of evidence which are disparate by necessity (9, 29).

These are queried, mined, appended to papers, and published. However, this representation ignores the argumentation contained within a paper and the relationships between hypotheses, claims and evidence put forth in the article. In this paper, we propose an alternate view of the research article as a network of ‚Äòhypotheses and evidence‚Äô. Our knowledge representation focuses on scientific discourse as a rhetorical activity, which leads to a different direction in the development of tools and processes for modeling this discourse. We propose to extract knowledge from the article to allow the construction of a system where a specific scientific claim is connected, through trails of meaningful relationships, to experimental evidence. We discuss some current efforts and future plans in this area.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:06.556603009Z","tags":null},"/R-In-Defense-of-Ambiguity":{"title":"R- In Defense of Ambiguity","content":"\n-   Title: In defense of ambiguity\n-   Meta:\n    -   Authored by:: [[Patrick J Hayes]] [[Harry Halpin]]\n    -   Year: [[2008]]","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:06.556603009Z","tags":null},"/R-Information-Foraging-Video":{"title":"R- Information Foraging Video","content":"\n{{\u003c youtube _IbTZBMHiY4 \u003e}}\n\n[[P- Yochai Bankler]] makes the argument in [[R- Wealth of Networks]] that people have a wealth of idle attention.

This is similar to [[R- Interactive Intent Modeling for Exploratory Search]] insofar as it shows you a bunch of socially generated tags, allows you to narrow it down by filtering tags in or out of the search results (like [[Roam Research|Roam's]] backlinks filters). This allowed people without prior background knowledge to learn a new domain about as well as those who came in with prior knowledge. This addresses a core problem in exploratory search with new domains: often you can't find what you are looking for because you don't know the vocabulary of the field. You enter the space searching for answers with a vocabulary that doesn't match the space. By seeing the most frequent tags in order from top to bottom, you are able to pick up on the vocabulary more quickly. Since these social tags were generated by experts, this facilitates the transfer of expertise to newcomers.

This observation suggests that research uncovering aspects of the human semantic, perceptual, and motor systems that inhibit the noticing of obscure features would enable researchers to identify effective techniques to overcome those obstacles. As a critical step in this research program, this study showed that the generic-parts technique can help people unearth the types of obscure features that can be used to overcome functional fixedness, which is a classic inhibitor to problem solving. Subjects trained on this technique solved on average 67% more problems than a control group did.

Ruotsalo et al.\nNote Authored by:: [[P- Brendan Langen]]\n\n### Interactive Intent Modeling for Exploratory Search\n\n#### Core Questions\n[[Q- How do we enable users to find what they're looking for when they are exploring a new area]]?\n- [[C- Users struggle to formulate queries in exploratory search tasks]]. \n\t\u003e Current interaction methods for supporting exploratory search are based on techniques that suggest terms or rephrased queries [62], document relevance feedback mechanisms [61], and faceted search interfaces that enable narrowing down the search within the initial query scope [104, 125]. These techniques put the user in a reactive role to filter search results rather than offering interaction affordances to actively direct the exploratory search process.\n\t\u003e As a consequence, an important goal of an information retrieval system is to assist the user in understanding and specifying his/her information needs [50]. In particular, when users are engaged in complex tasks, search may not be best supported with simplistic search user interfaces and ranking optimized to maximize relevance to a single query, but rather users are engaged with the system to maximize whole-session relevance [90]. \n\n\n[[Q- How do we design search systems that evolve with user knowledge of a topic]]?\n- [[C- An exploratory search system should help the reader cumulatively gain information]].\n\t\u003e Recent results suggest that systems leveraging knowledge about a user‚Äôs search intentions can provide higher quality task outcomes on a longer term, than systems that try to optimize the immediate results set against the present query [1, 41, 119].\n\t\u003e A search system best supporting the scientist to accomplish such a task would allow a dialogue between the system and the user to not only retrieve relevant results for a particular query but to also assist in discovering related information, conceptualizing the relevant information space for comprehending the available information, and helping to specify search intents that evolve throughout the course of the task when users learn and gain information.\n\t\u003e In exploratory search, what is encountered along the exploration affects the search intents and goals. Consequently, the system must provide the user with affordances to comprehend the information space, direct the search, and engage the user in the exploration process. \n\t\u003e At the same time, the system can learn from user interactions to assist the user in accomplishing the user‚Äôs task. Achieving a common understanding about search intents and goals requires an intrinsic interplay between the user and the information retrieval system.\n\n- [[C- Interacting with visualizations improves task performance in exploratory searches]].\n\t\u003e Our experiments, however, suggest that interactive visualization of search intentions improves user performance without compromising search effort.\n\t\u003e We believe it is evidence that users are able to process the information presented to them and provide effective feedback to the system. Together with the improved results in task and retrieval performance, fast and effective interaction shows that user can make efficient and effective decisions and that these decisions are beneficial for their task performance.\n\t\u003e The technical realization of the approach by using reinforcement learning with rewards obtained from user interactions and the effectiveness of the intent model for retrieval and the visualization for search result comprehension can be applied to information seeking beyond the present studies, for example, information exploration on the Web.\n\t\u003e Effective presentation of search results is important in exploratory information search scenarios where a user tries to gain understanding of a topic to retrieve more specific or related information in subsequent search iterations [75, 114]\n\t\u003e Successfully comprehending information content across search results lets the user relate the result documents to each other, the query, and the underlying information need, and to exploit the information content appropriately in further processing of the found information [64]..\n\t\u003e ...in general, we lack understanding of the benefits of the visualizations. Visualizations can possibly improve users‚Äô effectiveness or efficiency in understanding or comprehending the information collections, or alternatively act as complex proxies for simpler interactions that the users perform as a part of their information exploration processes.\n\t- Screenshot of Visualization with a query of 'computer vision' (IntentRadar)\n\t\t- ![[Interactive intent modeling search circle.png]]\n\t- Example of Interactive Intent Modeling in the Visualization (IntentRadar)\n\t\t- ![[CleanShot 2022-05-21 at 16.17.36@2x.png]]\n\n- [[I- A search engine with interactive intent modeling can update based on user understanding and aid comprehension]].\n- [[C- Updating search results via interactive intent modeling improves user comprehension during exploratory searches]].\n\t\u003e Our results indicate that the retrieval performance of the system is improved as a result of interactive intent modeling. Retrieval performance is not dependent on the type of visualization and can be attributed to the intent modeling.\n\t\u003e Interactive intent modeling is a technique that models the user‚Äôs evolving search intents over a search session. The model learns intent estimates from user feedback and visualizes them as keywords for interaction as shown in Figure 1. Consequently, interactive intent modeling forms an interactive loop between the system and the user to refine the user‚Äôs search intentions and direct the search process.\n\t\u003e At each iteration, a set of keywords is suggested to the user based on the feedback obtained in previous iterations. Given the evolutionary nature of exploratory search, it is important to exploit the feedback elicited from the user but also to balance it with exploration. Users must be able to focus on a specific subset of the documents (exploit), but at the same time to be able to broaden their search to more general, but still highly relevant, documents (explore). This learning procedure is called the exploration/exploitation tradeoff of reinforcement learning.\n\t\u003e Assisting the user in directing the search, the visualization shows both the current intent estimate, the alternative intents, and how the alternatives are related to the current intent estimate. The two-dimensional visualization shows the relevance of each keyword in the current estimated intent and the similarity of the keywords representing alternative intents.\n\t- Search Engine Comparison\n\t\t- ![[CleanShot 2022-05-21 at 16.18.11@2x.png]]\n\n- [[C- Visualizing the intent model improves task performance and comprehension without increasing effort]]. \n\t\u003e Our results suggest that exploratory search can benefit from visual search support. Support for concept recovery and mental work in the form of visually-supported reasoning in the visual space suggest opportunities for improved task outcomes and improved retrieval performance over the session.\n\t\u003e These findings suggest that visualized models can provide the users affordances, not only to direct their search but also to make sense of the information potentially available. The users also take advantage of these affordances without compromising the time spent between interactions.\n\t- User Interface with Visualization\n\t\t- ![[CleanShot 2022-05-21 at 16.18.43@2x.png]]\n\t- User Interface with No Visualization\n\t\t- ![[CleanShot 2022-05-21 at 16.18.51@2x.png]]\n\n[[C- Current search engines are effective for specific informational searches]].\n\u003e The current generation of information retrieval systems, such as the major Web search engines, is effective at identifying a small set of the most relevant documents given a well specified information need. However, it is easy to identify many situations where more complex exploratory search support is required and increasing real-world evidence suggests that users are struggling with exploratory search [81]. \n\n\nBrendan Notes\n[[Q- How can we retroactively provide users with new information related to their past searches]]? \n\n[[I- New findings can be pushed to a user based on their search history]].\n\n[[Q- In what situations does having more information decrease user confidence]]? \n\n\n###### Methodology\nTheir process differs from past attempts because: \n1) They actually allow the user to visualize alongside their search, instead of looking at queries or documentation\n2) They implement the experiment in a practical manner alongside a real-life data collection.\n3) They empircally validate the performance in situ, instead of against log files or artificial sessions.\n\n\n###### Experiment Design + Results\nExperiment 1 - Exploratory Search \n- 30 graduate students with technical backgrounds, familiar with literature searches, from 2 universities\n- \n\u003e RQ1 Task performance: Does interactive intent modeling lead to better task outcome? \n\u003e RQ2 Retrieval performance: Does interactive intent modeling result in high-quality retrieved information? \n\u003e RQ3 Interaction support: Does interactive intent modeling elicit useful interactions? \n\u003e RQ4 User experience: Does the increased complexity of the user interface design, compared to standard search interfaces, affect the subjective user experience?\n\n\u003e The task was defined as a scientific writing scenario, i.e., the participants were asked to prepare materials and an outline for writing an essay on a given topic. The assignments were: \n\t\u003e (1) Search for relevant articles to be used as references in the essay. \n\t\u003e (2) Search for relevant keywords representing topics to be used to structure the essay\n\n\u003e An interesting insight is that for the IntentRadar system, precision is slightly increasing toward the end of the session for novel documents. This suggests that richer interaction becomes crucial to discover novel information, in particular for these exploratory tasks that were studied in the experiment.\n\u003e This suggests that even though the participants were shown more keywords in the IntentRadar system, they were able to select relevant keywords from the display.\n\u003e Interestingly, the participants who used the IntentRadar system were significantly less convinced that they had found the right articles during the task. Given that the retrieval effectiveness was found to be significantly better for the IntentRadar system, and therefore the responses from the system were of better quality, a possible explanation is that because of the visualization the participants became more aware of other potentially relevant directions that they could not explore in the given time, and therefore might have been more informed about potentially relevant, but not yet explored, topics.\n\nExperiment 2 - Information Comprehension\n- 24 graduate students with technical backgrounds, from 2 universities\n\n\u003e the focus of the study was threefold. First, to study if the visualization would assist users in the comprehension process. Second, to study if the users preferred interaction with the visualization. Third, if the visualization would improve the output of the comprehension process. \n\u003e RQ5 Comprehension process: Do participants in the visualization condition inspect the search result space using the visualization more often than using the result list? \n\u003e RQ6 Interaction support: Do participants in the visualization condition select keywords from the visualization more often than from the result list? \n\u003e RQ7 Comprehension outcome: Does the visualization result in improved information comprehension outcome? \n\u003e RQ8 User Experience: Does the result presentation using the visualization result in improved user experience?\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:06.556603009Z","tags":null},"/R-Investigating-PhD-thesis-examination-reports":{"title":"R- Investigating PhD thesis examination reports","content":"\n-   Metadata:\n    -   Title: Investigating PhD thesis examination reports\n    -   Authored by:: [[Allyson Holbrook]]\n    -   Publication: International Journal of Educational Research\n    -   Tags:: #[[references]] #[[D/Synthesis Infrastructure]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:06.556603009Z","tags":null},"/R-Knowledge-Synthesis-a-conceptual-model-and-practical-guide":{"title":"R- Knowledge Synthesis- a conceptual model and practical guide","content":"\n\nhttps://oasislab.pubpub.org/pub/54t0y9mk/release/2\n\n## Challenges and desiderata for a synthesis system\n\nHere are some common failure modes for a synthesis system and process that I have experienced and observed in others (not mutually exclusive!):\n\n1.  **Too much detail** (too low-level, missing forest for trees). This manifests as a lack of higher-level synthesis of what a collection of results means. A common manifestation is the ‚Äúx said this, y said this, z said this‚Äù form of literature review.\n    \n2.  **Too little detail** (too high-level, missing the devil/diamonds in the details). This manifests as overgeneralization of claims, or glossing over critical inconsistencies or contradictions. A good example of this is debates about the role of ‚Äúchildren‚Äù in COVID-19 transmission that ignore the details of differences between young children (under 10).\n    \n3.  **Insufficient context**. This is related to the lack of details, but separate in that context can also come from connection to other claims: if this is missing, even observation notes can be lost because their significance isn‚Äôt recognized.\n    \n4.  **Information silos.** This manifests in part also due to inordinate detail-orientedness, where important connections across disciplines or topics are ignored. This can also come from too little detail! If results are described at too high a level, we might miss important connections at the subproblem level between problems and results.\n    \n5.  **Information overload**.

Yet dissertations provide the most powerful, objective measure of the success of a department‚Äôs doctoral program. Indeed, assessment, when done properly, can help departments achieve excellence by providing insight into a program‚Äôs strengths and weaknesses.This book and the groundbreaking study on which it is based is about making explicit to doctoral students the tacit ‚Äúrules‚Äù for the assessment of the final of all final educational products‚Äïthe dissertation. The purpose of defining performance expectations is to make them more transparent to graduate students while they are in the researching and writing phases, and thus to help them achieve to higher levels of accomplishment. Lovitts proposes the use of rubrics to clarify performance expectations‚Äìnot to rate dissertations or individual components of dissertations to provide a summary score, but to facilitate formative assessment to support, not substitute for, the advising process. She provides the results of a study in which over 270 faculty from ten major disciplines‚Äïspanning the sciences, social sciences, and humanities‚Äïwere asked to make explicit their implicit standards or criteria for evaluating dissertations. The book concludes with a summary of the practical and research implications for different stakeholders: faculty, departments, universities, disciplinary associations, accrediting organizations, and doctoral students themselves.The methods described can easily be adapted for the formative assessment of capstone courses, senior and master‚Äôs theses, comprehensive exams, papers, and journal articles.\n- #references\n    - Title: Making the Implicit Explicit: Creating Performance Expectations for the Dissertation\n    - Meta\n        - Tags: #ref/Book #[[D/Synthesis Infrastructure]] #[[P/Teach INST 888]]\n        - Authored by:: [[Barbara E.

My commentary is included under headings.*\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nMetadata is \"data about data\" -- information like keywords, page-length, title, word-count, abstract, location, SKU, ISBN, and so on. Explicit, human-generated metadata has enjoyed recent trendiness, especially in the world of XML. \n\n==A typical scenario goes like this: a number of suppliers get together and agree on a metadata standard -- a Document Type Definition or scheme -- for a given subject area, say washing machines. They agree to a common vocabulary for describing washing machines: size, capacity, energy consumption, water consumption, price. They create machine-readable databases of their inventory, which are available in whole or part to search agents and other databases, so that a consumer can enter the parameters of the washing machine he's seeking and query multiple sites simultaneously for an exhaustive list of the available washing machines that meet his criteria.  If everyone would subscribe to such a system and create good metadata for the purposes of describing their goods, services and information, it would be a trivial matter to search the Internet for highly qualified, context-sensitive results: a fan could find all the downloadable music in a given genre, a manufacturer could efficiently discover suppliers, travelers could easily choose a hotel room for an upcoming trip.==\n\nA world of exhaustive, reliable metadata would be a utopia. It's also a pipe-dream, founded on self-delusion, nerd hubris and hysterically inflated market opportunities.  BACK TO TOP]()\n\n- - - -\n\n# 2. The problems\n\nThere are at least seven insurmountable obstacles between the world as we know it and meta-utopia. I'll enumerate them below:\n\n- - - -\n\n## 2.1 People lie\n\nMetadata exists in a competitive world. Suppliers compete to sell their goods, cranks compete to convey their crackpot theories (mea culpa), artists compete for audience. Attention-spans and wallets may not be zero-sum, but they're damned close.\n\nThat's why:   A search for any commonly referenced term at a search-engine like Altavista will often turn up at least one porn link in the first ten results.  Your mailbox is full of spam with subject lines like \"Re: The information you requested.\"  Publisher's Clearing House sends out advertisements that holler \"You may already be a winner!\"  Press-releases have gargantuan lists of empty buzzwords attached to them.  \n\n==Meta-utopia is a world of reliable metadata. When poisoning the well confers benefits to the poisoners, the meta-waters get awfully toxic in short order.==\n\n### Robert Haisfield comments:\nthis is a user behavior / [[Behavioral Product Strategy]] problem. Dan Ariely and many others have research about honesty, and from what I read from Balaji, the blockchain and crypto may be a way to make it so you don't have to worry about people being honest. \n\n- - - -\n\n## 2.2 People are lazy\n\nYou and me are engaged in the incredibly serious business of creating information. ==Here in the Info-Ivory-Tower, we understand the importance of creating and maintaining excellent metadata for our information.==\n\n==But info-civilians are remarkably cavalier about their information. Your clueless aunt sends you email with no subject line, half the pages on Geocities are called \"Please title this page\" and your boss stores all of his files on his desktop with helpful titles like \"UNTITLED.DOC.\"==  \n\nThis laziness is bottomless. No amount of ease-of-use will end it. To understand the true depths of meta-laziness, download ten random MP3 files from Napster. Chances are, at least one will have no title, artist or track information -- this despite the fact that adding in this info merely requires clicking the \"Fetch Track Info from CDDB\" button on every MP3-ripping application.  Short of breaking fingers or sending out squads of vengeful info-ninjas to add metadata to the average user's files, we're never gonna get there.\n\n### Robert Haisfield comments:\nthis is a user behavior / [[Behavioral Product Strategy]] problem.\n\n- - - -\n\n## 2.3 People are stupid\n\n==Even when there's a positive benefit to creating good metadata, people steadfastly refuse to exercise care and diligence in their metadata creation. ==\n\n==Take eBay: every seller there has a damned good reason for double-checking their listings for typos and misspellings. Try searching for \"plam\" on eBay. Right now, that turns up nine typoed listings for \"Plam Pilots.\" Misspelled listings don't show up in correctly-spelled searches and hence garner fewer bids and lower sale-prices.== You can almost always get a bargain on a Plam Pilot at eBay.\n\nThe fine (and gross) points of literacy -- spelling, punctuation, grammar -- elude the vast majority of the Internet's users. To believe that J. Random Users will suddenly and en masse learn to spell and punctuate -- let alone accurately categorize their information according to whatever hierarchy they're supposed to be using -- is self-delusion of the first water. \n\n### Robert Haisfield comments:\nthis is a user behavior / [[Behavioral Product Strategy]] problem. You need some way to sort out the crap. Maybe [[crowdsource]] crap sorting would work. \n\n- - - -\n\n## 2.4 Mission: Impossible know thyself \n\nIn meta-utopia, everyone engaged in the heady business of describing stuff carefully weighs the stuff in the balance and accurately divines the stuff's properties, noting those results. \n\nSimple observation demonstrates the fallacy of this assumption. When Nielsen used log-books to gather information on the viewing habits of their sample families, the results were heavily skewed to Masterpiece Theater and Sesame Street. Replacing the journals with set-top boxes that reported what the set was actually tuned to showed what the average American family was really watching: naked midget wrestling, America's Funniest Botched Cosmetic Surgeries and Jerry Springer presents: \"My daughter dresses like a slut!\"  Ask a programmer how long it'll take to write a given module, or a contractor how long it'll take to fix your roof. Ask a laconic Southerner how far it is to the creek. Better yet, throw darts -- the answer's likely to be just as reliable.\n\nPeople are lousy observers of their own behaviors. Entire religions are formed with the goal of helping people understand themselves better; therapists rake in billions working for this very end.  Why should we believe that using metadata will help J.

Metadata can be quite useful, if taken with a sufficiently large pinch of salt. The meta-utopia will never come into being, but metadata is often a good means of making rough assumptions about the information that floats through the Internet.\n\nCertain kinds of implicit metadata is awfully useful, in fact. Google exploits metadata about the structure of the World Wide Web: by examining the number of links pointing at a page (and the number of links pointing at each linker), Google can derive statistics about the number of Web-authors who believe that that page is important enough to link to, and hence make extremely reliable guesses about how reputable the information on that page is.\n\nThis sort of observational metadata is far more reliable than the stuff that human beings create for the purposes of having their documents found. It cuts through the marketing bullshit, the self-delusion, and the vocabulary collisions.\n\nTaken more broadly, this kind of metadata can be thought of as a pedigree: who thinks that this document is valuable? How closely correlated have this person's value judgments been with mine in times gone by? This kind of implicit endorsement of information is a far better candidate for an information-retrieval panacea than all the world's schema combined.\n ","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:06.556603009Z","tags":null},"/R-Micropublications-a-semantic-model":{"title":"R- Micropublications a semantic model","content":"\n### Micropublications: a semantic model\n- #[[references]]\n    - Title: Micropublications: a semantic model for claims, evidence, arguments and annotations in biomedical communications\n    - Meta:\n        - Tags: #context #Atomicity #Atomicity #compositionality #[[D/Synthesis Infrastructure]] #std/Micropublication\n        - Authored by:: [[Tim Clark]] [[Paolo Ciccarese]] [[Carole A.

We develop query processing techniques that build on the primitives offered by the state of the art Natural Language Processing methods.\n\u003eWe begin by demonstrating that at the core, recent NLP transformers, powered by pre-trained language models, can answer select-project-join queries if they are given the exact set of relevant facts. However, they cannot scale to non-trivial databases and cannot perform aggregation queries.\n\u003eBased on these findings, we describe a NeuralDB architecture that runs multiple Neural SPJ operators in parallel, each with a set of database sentences that can produce one of the answers to the query. The result of these operators is fed to an aggregation operator if needed. \n\u003eWe describe an algorithm that learns how to create the appropriate sets of facts to be fed into each of the Neural SPJ operators. Importantly, this algorithm can be trained by the Neural SPJ operator itself.\n\u003e In applying neural nets to data management, research has so far assumed that the data was modeled by a database schema\n\u003e What if, instead, data and queries can be represented as short natural language sentences, and queries can be answered from these sentences?\n\u003e The query processor of a NeuralDB builds on the primitives that are offered by the state of the art Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.\n\u003e Our experimental results suggest that it is possible to attain very high accuracy for a class of queries that involve select, project, join possibly followed by an aggregation.\n\n\nNeuralDB has no predefined schema, can be queried in natural language, is backed by NLP, and can extend to more domain knowledge with training. \n\u003eThe first, and most important benefit is that a NeuralDB, by definition, has no pre-defined schema. Therefore, the scope of the database does not need to be defined in advance and any data that becomes relevant as the application is used can be stored and queried.\n\u003eThe second benefit is that updates and queries can be posed in a variety of natural language forms, as is convenient to any user. In contrast, a traditional database query needs to be based on the database schema.\n\u003eA third benefit comes from the fact that the NeuralDB is based on a pre-trained language model that already contains a lot of knowledge.\n\u003eFurthermore, using the same paradigm, we can endow the NeuralDB with more domain knowledge by extending the pre-training corpus to that domain.\n\n\u003e The main goal of NeuralDB is to support data management applications where users do not need to pre-define a schema. Instead, they can express the facts in the database in any linguistic form they want, and queries can be posed in natural language. To that end, data and queries in a NeuralDB are represented as short sentences in natural language and the neural machinery of the NeuralDB is applied to these sentences.\n\nQ- What are neural databases good for?\n\u003e Given its benefits, Neural Databases are well suited for emerging applications where the schema of the data cannot be determined in advance and data can be stated in a wide range of linguistic patterns. A family of such applications arise in the area of storing knowledge for personal assistants that currently available for home use and in the future will accompany Augmented Reality glasses. In these applications, users store data about their habits and experiences, their friends and their preferences, and designing a schema for such an application is impractical. Another class of applications is the modeling and querying of political claims [46] (with the goal of verifying their correctness). Here too, claims can be about a huge variety of topics and expressed in many ways. \n\u003e Our first contribution is to show that state of the art transformer models [47] can be adapted to answer simple natural language queries. Specifically, the models can process facts that are relevant to a query independent of their specific linguistic form, and combine multiple facts to yield correct answers, effectively performing a join. \n\u003e Our second contribution is to propose an architecture for neural databases that uses the power of transformers at its core, but puts in place several other components in order to address the scalability and aggregation issues. Our architecture runs multiple instances of a Neural SPJ operator in parallel. The results of the operator are either the answer to the query or the input to an aggregation operator, which is done in a traditional fashion. Underlying this architecture is a novel algorithm for generating the small sets of database sentences that are fed to each Neural SPJ operator\n\u003e Finally, we describe an experimental study that validates the different components of NeuralDBs, namely the ability of the Neural SPJ to answer queries or create results for a subsequent aggregation operator even with minimal supervision, and our ability to produce support sets that are fed into each of the Neural SPJ operators. Putting all the components together, our final result shows that we can accurately answer queries over thousands of sentences with very high accuracy. To run the experiments we had to create an experimental dataset with training data for NeuralDBs, which we make available for future research.\n\nQ- What are neural databases bad at?\nQ- How large of a dataset could be used with a neural database?\n\u003e However, we identify two major limitations of these models: (1) they do not perform well on aggregation queries (e.g., counting, max/min), and (2) since the input size to the transformer is bounded and the complexity of the transformer is quadratic in the size of its input, they only work on a relatively small collection of facts. \n\u003e We also assume that pronouns (e.g., she, they) are not used or have been resolved in advance. The application of the rich body of work on entity resolution to NeuralDBs will be reserved for future work.\n\nMore research is needed:\n\u003e To fully realize the promise of NeuralDBs, more research is needed on scaling up NeuralDBs to larger databases, supporting more complex queries and increasing the accuracy of the answers. In particular, an interesting area of research noted in Section 5 is developing novel indexing techniques that enable efficient support set generation. \n\u003e Another exciting area to investigate is to consider other media in the database. For example, a database can also contain a set of images and some queries can involve combining information from language and from images. Such an extension would benefit from recent progress on visual query answering systems [3, 5].\n\u003e Finally, another interesting challenge concerns developing semantic knowledge that helps in identifying which updates should replace previous facts and which should not.\n\n\nWhat challenges arise with databases that NeuralDB solves?\n\u003e However, the following additional challenges arise in the context of NeuralDBs: \n\t\u003e ‚Ä¢ Unlike open-book QA, which typically requires extracting a span from a single document or predicting a token as an answer, answering queries in a NeuralDB may require processing a large number of facts and in some cases performing aggregations over large sets. \n\t\u003e ‚Ä¢ NeuralDBs do not enjoy the locality properties that usually hold in open-book QA. In NeuralDBs, a query may be dependent on multiple facts that can be anywhere in the database. In fact, by definition, the current facts in a database can be reordered and the query answers should not change. In contrast, in open-book QA, the fact needed to answer a given question is typically located in a paragraph or document with multiple sentences about the same subject where this additional context may help information recall. \n\t\u003e ‚Ä¢ When determining which facts to input to the transformer, NeuralDBs may require conditional retrieval from the database. For example, to answer the query Whose spouse is a doctor? we‚Äôd first need to fetch spouses and then their professions. In the NLP community this is known as multihop query answering [6], which has recently become an active area of research, but restricted to the case where we‚Äôre looking for a single answer. In NeuralDBs, we may need to perform multi-hops for sets of facts.\n\t\u003e A possible downside of using neural techniques in a database system is the potential for bias that might be encoded in the underlying language model.\n\t\t\u003e A possible approach to this important issue is to design a separate module that attacks the database with queries in order to discover hidden biases. Then, we could devise safeguards within the database that ensure that we don‚Äôt use such biased knowledge in answering queries. Developing these components is an area for future research.\n\nMethodology\n\u003e The Transformer model [47] is the most common neural architecture to operate on pre-trained language models based on the high accuracy it produces on downstream tasks including question answering on text. In our prototype experiments, detailed in Section 3, we demonstrate that these reasoning abilities enable the transformer architecture to generate correct answers to a number of queries that we might pose to a NeuralDB.\n\u003e Evaluating accuracy of answers. We measure the correctness of the answers generated by a NeuralDB by comparing them against reference data that contain the correct answers. The neural networks are trained with subset of the available data, leaving a portion of it held-out for evaluation, referred to as the test set. \n\u003e For most queries, we measure correctness using Exact Match (EM), which is 1 if a binary the answer string generated by the NeuralDB is exactly equal to the reference answer and 0 otherwise. This metric is used to score outputs where either a Boolean, null answer, string or numeric answer is expected. \n\u003e When a set of results is returned, we also consider the ùêπ1 score that weighs the precision and recall of the answer generated by the NeuralDB as compared to the reference data\n\u003e They are typically trained in one of two configurations: encoder only or encoder-decoder. In the former, each token is encoded to a vector representation that is used to predict a label. In the latter, used in sequence-to-sequence applications (e.g., question answering or machine translation), the decoder produces the output sequence. \n\u003e In both configurations, the transformer works in two phases. In the first phase, the transformer encodes the input into an intermediate representation z = (ùëß1, . . . , ùëßùëõ) where the dimension of the vector is fixed, typically where ùëëùëöùëúùëëùëíùëô = 768. In the second phase, the transformer decodes z to produce the output. For example, in sequence-to-sequence generation the output would be a sequence of tokens y = (ùë¶1, . . . , ùë¶ùëô ), ending with a special token.\n\u003e We generate training data in a controlled fashion using data from Wikidata [48] to express facts in natural language. Because of the scale of Wikidata, it is possible to generate large numbers of training instances about a wide range of relationships requiring very few templates.\n\u003e We believe that the initial experiment suggests the following: (1) if there were a way to feed the transformer the relevant facts from the database, it can produce results with reasonable accuracy, (2) aggregation queries need to be performed outside of the neural machinery, and (3) in order to handle queries that result in sets of answers and in order to prepare sets for subsequent aggregation operators, we need to develop a neural operator that can process individual (or small sets of) facts in isolation and whose results outputted as the answer or fed into a traditional (i.e. nonneural) aggregation operator.\n\nRelated Work\n\u003e NLP and data management. Bridging the gap between unstructured natural language data and database-style querying has been a longstanding theme in database research [15]. The work on information extraction has developed techniques for translating segments of natural language text into triples that can be further processed by a database system. Wikidata [48] itself is a social experiment where additions to the knowledge graph are encouraged to use already existing relation names if possible, thereby alleviating the need for information extraction. There has been significant work on translating queries posed in natural language into SQL queries on a database whose schema is known [4, 23, 58], with extensions to semi-structured data and knowledge bases [7, 30]. More recently, systems such as BREAK [57] and ShARC [41] have trained models to translate a natural language query into a sequence of relational operators (or variants thereof).\n\u003e While other works modeling the web as a knowledge bases have focused on combining multiple snippets of text together [44], their assumption is that the query is decomposed into a SPARQL program that is executed on pre-extracted information. Our innovation is that no latent program or structure is needed and that information extraction is dynamic and dependent on the query.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:06.556603009Z","tags":null},"/R-Open-Ideas":{"title":"R- Open Ideas","content":"https://perama-v.github.io/ethereum/ideas\n## Introduction\n\n\u003e **Premise:** Anything that humans create must first be an idea.

Some ideas are unreasonable until one part of the idea block is created.\n\u003e Consider that a laser finder on a bow and arrow is a reasonable idea once a laser is a building block (bow + laser). The idea is a bad idea for the bowmaker if a laser has not already been invented.\n\n### Ideation rate and cumulative idea count\n\nideationRate = f(numIdeators numIdeasInMind)\n\u003e The ideation rate is likely to be some function of the\n\u003e - Number of people trying to generate ideas. The system does not address this factor.\n\u003e - The number of ideas from which to draw from and combine in unique ways. Ideas can be drawn from only when they coexist in a single mind. Thus, an idea is most useful when it is present in the minds of all the ideators.\n\nThis paper is trying to work on ideation at the population level, not the individual level. People can only compose ideas they have in their head, ideas are more useful compositional building blocks when you have many.\n\n\u003e **Individual idea pool:** A person might be imagined as having a reserve of ‚Äòpotential ideas‚Äô that they may convert into ‚Äòreal ideas‚Äô. A person mentally occupied (e.g., busy with some work or task), may not generate any ideas from this pool. Another individual who intentionally tries to generate ideas might produce a large proportion of this pool.\n\n\u003e One potential model for ideation is combinatorial sampling. The mind might draw elements from the pool and combine them, evaluate the result and then explore the idea if it passess this filter. If the rate of sampling is constant, then the rate of ‚Äògood‚Äô ideas is a function of the merit of the idea in achieving some arbitrary (and possible poorly-defined) goal.\n\n\u003e If the idea is composed of a collection of real and effective tools that are available for use, then the idea is more likely to seem good (E.g., an idea that relies on a known realistic/manufacturable alloy is better than one that uses a non-existent alloy). Therefore, if the ideator has a large pool of contemporary ideas from which to sample from (E.g., they are aware of the idea of the alloy), they might have a higher rate of ‚Äògood‚Äô ideas.\n\nSecondary ideas can be good if they are built on primary ideas that are currently possible, even if the secondary idea is not currently possible.\n\u003e A primary idea, one what is based on available technologies, can serve as the basis for a secondary idea.\n\nI disagree with this a bit: If people are constantly exposed to new ideas, then they may not have the mental bandwidth to generate new ideas of their own. In terms of design challenges, one might ask: [[Q- How might we use software to increase the total number of ideas available for composition]]? A big part of that is just limiting the requirement to hold all ideas in their head - a thought processor with a solid exploratory browsing and recommendation engine could be one answer\n\u003e **Pool growth:** An increase in the total number of ideas available for consumption increases the rate of ideation at the individual level, which then increases the rate of new ideas produced by and for society. If it is true that ideas are combinations of existing ideas, then an individual exposed to more ideas will have a greater idea-count potential. The possible number of new ideas available for the individual to is likely a superlinear function of available ideas. As the number of ideas available for an individual to draw from and combine grows, the number of potential combinations grows superlinearly.\n\n\n### Historical context\n\nSome ideas are not yet ready to share, but not sharing them means you lose out on the opportunities for collaboration. People delay the time-to-publication as a solution, but getting a patent can take years. If you can shorten that time-to-publication delay to days, you create more actionable ideas for the world to build on.\n\n#### Design\n\nPublish hashes of the idea to the blockchain. There's now a persistent destination for payments to be routed over the course of years. The timestamp proves when it happened. Each file consists of data used to construct an attribution graph.\n\n##### Data availability\n\n- Stored in layer 2 contract:\n\t- Current latest idea hash as storage in\n- Stored in peer to peer filestore:\n\t- Sequence of idea_hashe\n\t- Ideas, consisting of\n\t\t- Author L2 public key address\n\t\t- Idea description\n\n\u003e Why not put the attributions as storage on L2 - the system is opt-in, and it is reasonable to assume that anyone making a payment will parse the graph correctly when gathering the addresses and payment proportions to make a donation.\n\n##### Idea data structure\n\n```\n{\n  \"author_public_key\": 0x12345,\n  \"idea\": \"idea x\",\n  \"attributions\": [\n    (3ea..8c, 0.3),\n    (34b..d7, 0.6),\n    (581..ae, 0.1)\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n##### Payments\n\n\u003e Someone wishing to distribute funds to the graph uses the client to generate a list of public keys and weights. The list is then passed to the smart contract along with the funds. The payment is split and distributed by weight. The client generates a transaction payload that can be submitted to a payment contract to divide the funds.\n\n###### Attributions\n\nPayment decays along the graph as it splits the payments to all contributors of the idea through time.\n\n```\n- 0.1 main idea (1kk)\n  - 0.6 Send: 600k\n  - 0.4 Attributions (400k)\n    - 0.7 Secondary idea 1 (280k)\n      - 0.5 Send: 140k\n      - 0.5 Attributions (140k)\n        - 0.9 Tertiary idea 1 (126k)\n          - 0.6 Send: 75.6k\n          - 0.4 Attributions (50.4k)\n            - 0.8 Quaternery idea 1 (40.4k)\n            - 0.2 Quaternery idea 1 (10.8k)\n        - 0.1 Tertiary idea 2 (14k)\n    - 0.2 Secondary idea 2 (80k)\n      - 0.9 Send: 72k\n      - 0.1 Attributions (8k)\n        - 0.7 Tertiary idea 3 (5.6k)\n        - 0.3 Tertiary idea 4 (2.4k)\n    - 0.05 Secondary idea 3 (20k)\n      - 0.6 Send: 12k\n      - 0.4 Attributions: (8k)\n        - 0.9 Tertiary idea 5 (7.2k)\n        - 0.1 Tertiary idea 6 (0.8k)\n    - 0.05 Secondary idea 4 (20k)\n      - 0.1 Send: 2k\n      - 0.9 Attributions (18k)\n        - 0.6 Tertiary idea 7 (10.8k)\n        - 0.4 Tertiary idea 8 (7.2k)\n```\n\n\u003e The ideator could under-allocate the percentage that they choose to attribute to preceeding ideas. However, given that the graph is public, there is a degree of social pressure that disincentivises this. The ideator hopes to attract funds, and therefore is likely to be honest about the contribution (the nature of which can be seen).\n\n#### Intellectual property\n\n\u003e The ideas presented in the graph are not a claim of intellectual property.

The term organizational memory is due for an overhaul. Memory appears to be everywhere in organizations; yet, the term has been limited to only a few uses. Based on an ethnographic study of a telephone hotline group, this paper presents a micro-level, distributed cognition analysis of two hotline calls, the work activity surrounding the calls, and the memory used in the work activity. Drawing on the work of Star, Hutchins, and Strauss, the paper focuses on issues of applying past information for current use. Our work extends Strauss' and Hutchins' trajectories to get at the understanding of potential future use by participants and its role in current information storage. We also note the simultaneously shared provenance and governance of multiple memories ‚Äì human and technical. This analysis and the theoretical framework we construct should be to be useful in further efforts in describing and analyzing organizational memory within the context of knowledge management efforts.\n    - lit-context\n        - #canonical ref for [context], helps flesh out how [[Z: Contextualizability is necessary for synthesis]]\n        - setting:: telephone hotline group (HLG) for human resources (e.g., benefits, personnel policies) in a well-established mid-sized (~1000+ employees) company in Silicon Valley\n            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FmipeLvxEgY.png?alt=media\u0026token=55f0a290-cbef-471d-8e5c-98c5025b1296) (p. 165)\n            - main participant whose transcript is analyzed (here called the HLG employee) was an experienced agent who had been at the company for 5 years, and at the hotline group for 1 year\n                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2Ff0Dn98k5Mf.png?alt=media\u0026token=a7f0515a-563b-459a-9473-682b9031a93b) (p. 165)\n    -  lit-notes\n        - [observation-notes]\n            - A HLG employee drew on five discrete \"small memories\" in her handling of a hotline call, such as the telephone system's short-term memory of the group's activity, her own short-term memory, scrap paper, the CAll Tracking (CAT) system, and records in the CARL database, instead of a single monolithic memory\n                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FaM33W1lmur.png?alt=media\u0026token=283ac83a-fc6a-4d4e-b841-468c9c3f7243) (p. 168)\n                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FhfTG3GBanW.png?alt=media\u0026token=6aa3ad03-271a-4cc4-aa49-5ab2af2fb0d0) (p. 169)\n            - To properly deal with a discrepancy in benefits from the caller, a HLG employee needed to [reuse] information from the CARL database, among other sources of information, to create an escalation to the benefits group.

Multi-level content refers to the idea that there are multiple levels at which you can describe a concept. For example, a paper's abstract may be understood as a high level overview of the paper's contents. For some, the abstract might be enough, but for others, they will need to read the paper for low level details.\n\nThe author provides The Cognitive Bias Codex as an example of multi-level content communication. Going from the outer rings to the inner rings, there are four categories that describe 20 subcategories which describe 180 specific cognitive biases. This allows readers to gain a high level conceptual overview and then narrow in on the specific subjects they care about.\n![[Cognitive Bias Codex.png]]\n\nThe paper refers to \"the problem of multiple knowledge levels.\" Essentially, knowledge has a hierarchical structure, and if high level overviews or low level details are missing, it becomes harder to understand. Additionally, if high level overviews are visually undifferentiated from low level details, then the reader might waste their time trying to understand the domain in a more difficult way.\n\nIn some ways, [[P- Francis Miller]] is attempting to solve a problem of [[Search Behavior]] in an exploratory search setting. Essentially, how can people find what they are looking for, even when they do not know how to describe what they are looking for? Starting with broad questions and progressively drilling down into specific domains may be an effective search strategy. After all, [[C- An exploratory search system should help the reader cumulatively gain information]].\n\n[[Start Here|Writing in hypertext]] attempts to solve the same problem. Whenever the reader is unclear about a concept, they can click on the hyperlink, read about it, and then bring their new knowledge back to the note that they were originally reading. When the hypertext links have descriptive titles, they provide an \"[[Search Behavior|information scent]]\" that informs the reader whether it will be worthwhile to follow that link's path.\n\nHowever, hypertext differs from what Miller proposes insofar as it describes a flat information architecture. In hypertext, you can start on any page and explore outwards. Compared to Miller's abstract to specific search strategy, however, it may be inefficient.\n\nOne solution to the problem of multi-level content is apparent in the structure of the paper. First there is a summary of the paper as a whole, followed by a summary of each of the four parts, followed by each of the four parts. While the paper itself is more than 90 pages, the expectation is that people will only need to read the subset of those pages necessary to satisfy their interests.\n\nAnother idea present in the paper is a [[ZUI|Zoomable User Interface]]. While the term was not explicitly mentioned, the author alluded to the concept. Imagine a digital map. When you zoom in, you see the names of specific streets and stores, but when you zoom out, those fade away and are replaced with the names of towns and cities. Now imagine a discourse graph where you can zoom in or out to go from increased detail to broader abstractions.\n\nThis implies the necessity of [[I- Summarization as a primitive]]. \n\n[[C- A key requirement to participating in a discourse graph for a specific domain is knowing the vocabulary used in that graph]]. ZUIs that support abstract to specific search strategies can facilitate people learning the vocabulary they need.\n\nThe paper also shows multiple types of knowledge structure which may be taken into consideration to answer [[Q- What is the data structure of a graph built to facilitate decentralized knowledge synthesis]].\n![[Pasted image 20211019173927.png]]\n![[Pasted image 20211019174114.png]]\n\nAdditionally, Miller makes the argument that the very act of making knowledge maps that communicate the multiple-level content is rewarding and fruitful. When considering the question [[Q- What are powerful interfaces for entering information into a discourse graph]] with the goal of promoting synthesis, we should bear this in mind. Map making is itself a primitive. Zooming It allows you to identify gaps and patterns that would otherwise remain undiscovered without a forcing function to lay out all of the information and its structure from top to bottom. \n\n![[Pasted image 20211019174658.png]]\n\n[[Figma]] now lets you zoom in and out on comment threads and clusters.

However, it's time for someone else to pick up the torch of tree-based editing.\n\n![](https://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.18169-9/11924259_10153576067688675_6046809493243199041_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110\u0026ccb=1-3\u0026_nc_sid=abc084\u0026_nc_ohc=3owH-HCk58kAX9ULsSF\u0026_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.xx\u0026oh=296e8d6ac531295e603b1e09f6b3573c\u0026oe=60D997A3)\n\n_In Prune, programmers transform the tree directly_\n\n## **The Dream**\n\nPrune is a code editor that operates directly on the tree structure of the code. While it renders code in a familiar textual format, it doesn't offer text editing operations. Programs are created and edited by creating, deleting, and re-organizing nodes in the program's abstract syntax tree.\n\nPrune grew out of hundreds of hours of observing programmers editing programs with text editors. Proficient users spent considerable energy learning and optimizing their use of the editor. Unskilled users spent considerable energy using the editor badly. Perhaps the problem is not their skill, but the whole idea of using a text editor, a very general tool, for the specific task of program editing.\n\nStructure editors have been around for decades, yet they never caught on for mainstream usage. Prune would have to be substantially better to have a chance of being adopted. While our overall goal was to reduce the cognitive load of manipulating programs, \"cognitive load\" is hard to measure, so we chose three quantifiable goals:\n\n-   Fewer keystrokes\n-   Fewer errors\n-   Greater overall efficiency\n\n## **Tree Transformations**\n\nThe fundamental operation in Prune takes one program tree and produces another. For example, making a statement conditional is a single operation:\n\n```\ncache = computeValue; ==\u003e if (!cache) {   cache = computeValue; }\n```\n\nThis transformation is one of a class of \"wrap\" transformation--take the current selection, make it a child of a new node, and replace the selection with the new node. Other \"wraps\" are looping over a statement or statements, surrounding statements with an exception handler, and returning the value of an expression. Mirror \"unwrap\" transformations replace a parent node with one or more of its children, such as making a statement unconditional only executing it once instead of in a loop. Other transformations create nodes, delete nodes, and reorder nodes.\n\nThe transformations are all atomic, in that they take a syntactically correct program and produce another syntactically correct program. This is one way Prune helps reduce errors--programs are syntactically correct by construction. The transformations compose--each takes a tree and a selection and produces a tree and a selection that can act as the input to another transformation. Once we had a basic library of transformations, we found that we could sometimes synthesize new transformations by composition instead of having to write new code to manipulate the tree. The transformations are also reversible, a property lacking in many text editors that have been enhanced to work on code.\n\n## **[[I should be able to leave a hole to fill in the blanks for an idea or domain|TBD Node]]**\n\nOne serendipitous discovery that deserves special mention is the TBD node, used above. Some transformations require two or more parameters. For example, creating a binary expression requires a left side, a right side, and an operator. In a panic we added a special node to the tree representing code to be filled in later. We found it useful in many situations and it never intruded on our work as users of Prune. It did require us to modify the pretty printer we used (esprima), but it was well worth it.\n\nOne piece of interface philosophy we carried through Prune is that the editor should allow the user to build a tree by introducing nodes in any order. We have so little experience coding through tree transformations that we have no confidence we have found the most efficient sequence (if one exists). \n\n## **Typeahead**\n\nOne of the risks we identified at the beginning of the project was the number of distinct transformation. If hundreds or thousands of distinct transformations were required to program effectively no one would want to learn them all.\n\nIt turns out that a hundred or so transformation suffice for editing JavaScript (our source and our target language). Even a hundred transformations is a lot to remember. When we measured our performance editing samples of code, we found selecting transformations and entering identifiers to be a bottleneck.\n\nTo accelerate editing and make Prune feel more familiar, we created a typeahead. When the user begins typing, Prune can guess what tree transformation is implied. For example, typing \"if\" implies a conditional, a guess that is confirmed when a space follows. The If transformation is invoked at that point, leaving the typeahead ready for input at the condition. \n\nWith practice, pruning with the typeahead feels a little like just typing. However, all the \"noise\" characters, put there just to make the parser happy, like parentheses and curly braces appear automatically. Typeahead adds to the efficiency of editing, reduces keystrokes, and makes Prune more approachable.\n\n## **The Project**\n\nPrune began as a part-time project, motivated, as mentioned earlier, by watching programmers struggle with text editors. The first prototype was completely simulated on paper, just enough to validate that reducing the keystroke count was possible.\n\nWith that bit of evidence in hand, the authors applied for a Hackamonth. After a year with the same team, Facebook engineers are encouraged to take a month and work on something unrelated. It's considered reasonable to fail attempting an ambitious hack, so off we went. Early in the project we created a Facebook-only group devoted to Prune, which slowly accumulated interested members as we posted the results of experiments, demo videos, and the occasional plea for someone to put us out of our misery.\n\nAfter the first month we had a version of Prune that we were able to frequently use to add features to Prune. However, reflection on usage showed that our pure \"invoke transformations through key bindings\" wasn't going give us the efficiency we wanted. We applied for a second month to implement and measure the typeahead.\n\nAt the end of the second month the developers and those who were interested in embedding Prune in their tools met to discuss its future. In the end we struck a rock we had identified in our first presentation--programmers don't spend that much time manipulating programs compared to all the other things they do. Doing the math, enabling a few hundred programmers to do a 50% better job (an ambitious goal) of a task requiring 10% of their time just doesn't make economic sense.\n\nHowever, we were surprised by what we learned working on Prune and we hope the ideas live and grow. That's why we are publishing this, in hopes that a graduate student somewhere won't mind a project that takes over his or her life and brings joy to (eventually) millions.\n\n## **The Lessons**\n\n-   Pure tree transformation is a viable option for editing code. The goals of reducing keystrokes and errors are within reach.\n-   Insisting on a pure tree transformation-based editor accelerated our research. If we had a text editor to fall back on, we wouldn't have thought hard enough about the problems that were eventually solved by the typeahead.\n-   Dogfooding is a powerful resource allocation heuristic. A complete code editor is a sizeable beast, but implementing what we needed to make the next change to Prune in Prune gave us a series of bite-sized features in a reasonable order. Bad experiences helped us quickly eliminate bad ideas.\n-   Structure research around questions, not features. We were able to get answers to critical questions about efficiency quickly because we were explicit about what questions we were asking. Working features to completion would have delayed, by months or years, those answers.\n-   Collaborate. Most Hackamonths are fairly solitary affairs, with an engineer seconded to a host team but running a separate project. We coded together daily in spite of our geographical split, which resulted in faster learning, more energy, and fewer dead-ends.\n-   We didn't miss formatting. We are both fussy about code formatting, but almost as soon as we were constrained to what the pretty-printer (esprima) gave us, we didn't waste any more thought on it.\n-   Typing is an effective way of identifying and invoking tree transformations.\n\n## **Future**\n\nOne of the curses and blessings of programming at Facebook is there is no shortage of impact work, so both of us reluctantly decided to move on. We still believe in the promise of tree-based editing and would love to use a completed version of Prune. We hope to encourage someone out there to take up the torch. Here are a few tips if it's you:\n\n-   Target a tablet first. Going head-to-head with vim and emacs is always going to be tough. Deliver on an input-deprived format like tablets, though, and you increase your chance of success. Prune's sparing use of input may also open up the possibility of voice input or other ways of making programming accessible to programmers who find typing difficult.\n-   Use a declarative language to define transformations. We defined out transformations imperatively, which was tedious and error prone.\n-   Use a predictive parser, one that can tell you what characters can legally come next and what tree transformations each character implies. We wrote an ugly, fragile state machine for our typeahead, which quickly became a source of pain and shame.\n-   Try to use the language-oriented tools from JetBrains. It seems like they have infrastructure that might make Prune an order of magnitude easier to implement.\n-   Implement macros. Letting programmers compose their own sequences of composable transformations seems like a good way to learn what operations are needed.\n-   Reuse the transformations. It seems like it should be possible to write a version control system that merges streams of transformations instead of textual diffs, potentially reducing the number of merge conflicts.\n-   Code tree transformations declaratively. We coded them imperatively and it took much too long.\n-   To further reduce the input required, consider using machine learning to predict which transformation will come next. Tune it well enough and much of programming could become \"yep, yep, yep\", saving the hard thinking for the hard problems.\n\nHappy pruning.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:06.56060299Z","tags":null},"/R-Reasons-for-the-use-and-nonuse-of-electronic-journals-and-databases":{"title":"R- Reasons for the use and non‚Äêuse of electronic journals and databases","content":"- #references\n    - Title: Reasons for the use and non‚Äêuse of electronic journals and databases: A domain analytic study in four scholarly disciplines\n    - Authored by::  Sanna Talja ,  Hanni Maula\n        - Tags:: #[[D/Synthesis Infrastructure]] #[[Domain-Analysis]]\n    - Year: 2003\n    - Publication: [[Journal of Documentation]]\n- Reading notes\n    - Key ideas:\n        - [[paradigmatic relevance]] is an important and distinct notion of relevance (compared to [[Topical Relevance]]) in scholarly information seeking (p. 676)\n            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FU9qtg2BxYc?alt=media\u0026token=70f344e8-d8c9-4ec1-83f3-82f47b57223c)\n            - Some kinds of information seeking strategies are better fits for [[paradigmatic relevance]]\n                - #Claim Subject headings and keyword searches are more effective for domains with high [[Topical Relevance]]; in domains characterized more by [[paradigmatic relevance]], these stragies are less useful, and other strategies like [[chaining]] or [[Browsing]] are more powerful.

Even in a 500 node single-user network, navigational access can be difficult as the network changes and its structure becomes heterogeneous. In these cases, navigational access is problematic because users tend to get lost while wandering around in the network looking for some target information. Often these users can describe exactly what information they are looking for, but sim- ply cannot find it in the network.","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:06.56060299Z","tags":null},"/R-Replication-Communication-and-the-Population-Dynamics-of-Scientific-Discovery":{"title":"R- Replication Communication and the Population Dynamics of Scientific Discovery","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:06.56060299Z","tags":null},"/R-Roam-can-loosely-be-considered-a-DSL-with-a-structural-editor":{"title":"R- Roam can loosely be considered a DSL with a structural editor","content":"\n[[P- Elzr|Eli Parra]]'s [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/elzr/status/1378821500246065154) visualizes how [[Roam Research| Roam Research]] can be expanded upon through its base structure.

The web was able to scale aggressively because of 1-way links, but [[C- Claims gain implict meaning through their context of use]], and added [[C- Context is necessary for knowledge reuse|context is necessary for knowledge reuse]]. The invention of wikilinks was a step to enable Roam's core structure of bidirectional linking.\n\nRoam's adaptation is making 2-way links a first class citizen. Combined with the ability for end users to program their own templates and workflows, Roam [[C- A DSL allows people to expand their use cases far beyond the imagination of the designer|allows people to expand their use cases far beyond the imagination of the designer]].\n\nThis speaks to an idea of [[I- A DSL for a discourse graph with information entry, visualization, and retrieval|a DSL for a discourse graph with information entry, visualization, and retrieval]] being part of the design of a decentralized discourse graph.

The internet is rapidly becoming the first place for researchers to publish documents, but at present they receive little support in searching, tracking, analysing or debating concepts in a literature from scholarly perspectives. This paper describes the design rationale and implementation of ScholOnto, an ontology-based digital library server to support scholarly interpretation and discourse. It enables researchers to describe and debate via a semantic network the contributions a document makes, and its relationship to the literature. The paper discusses the computational services that an ontology-based server supports, alternative user interfaces to support interaction with a large semantic network, usability issues associated with knowledge formalisation, new work practices that could emerge, and related work.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:06.56060299Z","tags":null},"/R-Scholars-Before-Researchers":{"title":"R- Scholars Before Researchers","content":"\n-   #[[references]]\n    -   Title: Scholars Before Researchers: On the Centrality of the Dissertation Literature Review in Research Preparation\n    -   Meta:\n        -   Tags: #[[references]] #[[D/Synthesis Infrastructure]]\n        -   Authored by:: [[David N.

[[Q- How do people come to agree on queryable schemas]]\n\u003e Graphs allow maintainers to postpone the definition of a schema, allowing the data ‚Äì and its scope ‚Äì to evolve in a more flexible manner than typically possible in a relational setting\n\n[[Q- How do people come to agree on queryable schemas]]\n\u003e ‚ÄúSchemas‚Äù, if they exist, may be ad-hoc and unenforced, which often results in data that feels ‚Äúhalf structured‚Äù. This is not a sign of poor quality or problematic incompleteness, but rather a core distinguishing characteristic of knowledge graphs.\n\u003e\u003e Knowledge graphs are often assembled from numerous sources, and as a result, can be highly diverse in terms of structure and granularity. To address this diversity, representations of _schema_, _identity_, and _context_ often play a key role, where a _schema_ defines a high-level structure for the knowledge graph, _identity_ denotes which nodes in the graph (or in external sources) refer to the same real-world entity, while _context_ may indicate a specific setting in which some unit of knowledge is held true\n\n[[Q- What would be a protocol that would allow various protocols to communicate with each other]]\n\u003e Simply describing the technical structure of knowledge graphs misses a key aspect, which is _where the data comes from_ and _how the database is maintained_. ==Knowledge graphs are graph databases _that come from_ the integration of data from many sources and in many domains.== In other words, you make a knowledge graph by pulling data about lots of different kinds of things together in one place. This is part of what might justify calling them _knowledge_ graphs, since it involves ==parsing out latent common structure behind ‚Äúmere data‚Äù as it exists already, and aligning that common structure in a single space.== A knowledge graph is a graph that has somehow unified or reconciled the entities and relationships shared between (previously) separate data sources.\n\n[[Q- What would be a protocol that would allow various protocols to communicate with each other]] [[Q- How do people come to agree on queryable schemas]]\n\u003e Obviously not all entities and relationships are shared, but intuitively we feel that many are: an employee in a company directory can be treated as the same class of thing as a city resident in a census. ==Within each original dataset, the two will have different set of properties, but an external human curator can reasonably infer that they refer to the same type of real-world entity.==\n\n[[Q- What user behavior is required to maintain a decentralized knowledge graph]]\n\u003e Lastly, there‚Äôs a continuous, living, process-oriented aspect to knowledge graphs:\n\u003e\u003e ==‚Ä¶ effective methods for _extraction_, _enrichment_, _quality assessment_, and _refinement_ are required for a knowledge graph to grow and improve over time==\n\n\u003e This isn't about schemas in the technical database sense. ==Two databases might have the exact same schema, but still represent slightly (or wildly) different things.== The real thing that integration accomplishes is more like [ontology alignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_alignment), an operation on abstract structures that just happens to be expressed as a mapping from one database into another. Typically we don‚Äôt work with or even think about explicit ontologies - we just rely on natural-language property names and general context instead - but it‚Äôs useful to imagine they exist because it helps explain why integration is so notoriously painful. The complexity and similarity of the actual schemas involved isn't even that relevant; what matters is how well the underlying concepts align.\n\u003e \n\u003e To illustrate this, suppose that we have a general-purpose knowledge graph full of entities like people, places, and things. ==Let‚Äôs say we also scrape GitHub to build a collaboration graph of GitHub accounts, and now we‚Äôd like to integrate this into our knowledge graph so that we can query for collaborator relationships between people. We're immediately faced with the distinction between people and user accounts, which are not quite the same thing.== People might have several accounts - maybe different ones for personal and work projects - and any account might be used by more than one person.\n\u003e \n\u003e There are two basic strategies that we can apply to align these ontologies.\n\u003e \n\u003e **One option is to just ignore the difference and merge the two classes based on email, full name, or whatever we have, and add the new ‚Äúcollaborator‚Äù relationships directly between people in the knowledge graph.** This keeps the graph as simple as possible - we‚Äôre just adding data and not reorganizing anything - but the sacrifice we make in doing so is that we distort the data we're integrating. **People and user accounts are simply different kinds of things, and treating them as the same will give us extra or missing links due to the mismatch between the underlying ontologies. This effect could be called _dilution_ or _compression_ or _erosion_.**\n\u003e \n\u003e **Our other option is to make separate entities for each user account, and then relate them to the associated people whenever we can.** Maybe we‚Äôd even introduce a new ‚ÄúAgent‚Äù class, with both Person and User Account as subclasses, plus a ‚Äúrepresents‚Äù relationship between Agents. Then maybe we add some inference rule about ‚Äúif Agent A represents Agent B, Agent C represents Agent D, and Agent A and Agent C are collaborators, then Agent B and Agent D are collaborators too‚Äù, so that we can query for collaboration relationships between people like we wanted. **Here, we‚Äôve been more faithful with our alignment, but only at the expense of accumulating complexity in the process.**\n\u003e \n\u003e In practice, we usually end up using a combination of the two when integrating new data, leaving us with a result that is (oddly enough) both slightly simplified and slightly more complex than the data that we started with. This trade-off is unavoidable; the real value proposition of knowledge graphs is in the balancing of these extremes. ==If we apply too many simplifying assumptions, we‚Äôll wind up with data that bears so little resemblance to its sources that it is effectively useless. On the other hand, if we accumulate too much complexity, we'll get a knowledge graph that is so convoluted that it becomes effectively unusable.== The best we can do is shoot for a middle ground that's reasonably expressive and reasonably manageable.\n\n\u003e And there is some theory that we can try to apply. [[Category theory]] in particular is rich with many of these themes, like qualified relationships and compositional mappings. And sure enough, lots of applied category theory work revolves around databases, schemas, integration, ontologies, and knowledge representation - sometimes [very abstract](https://arxiv.org/abs/1102.1889v1), sometimes [shockingly practical](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04881).

So he is essentially a learning scientist in practice. \n            - He is also an [autodidact], committed to constantly learning, for example, [how to teach a beginner topic](https://www.ianjones.us/2020-02-10-how-to-teach-a-beginner-topic). He is very concerned with creating a \"[second brain]\", and tries to write to learn to [create grist and reference material for courses or blog posts](https://www.ianjones.us/notes).\n            - Initially he [used](https://www.ianjones.us/2019-12-19-how-we-use-notions) [[sys/Notion]] (in part through influence of being in [Building a Second Brain (BASB)] cohort), then [moved to](https://www.ianjones.us/2019-12-19-roam-research) [[Roam Research]], but recently [decided to move](https://www.ianjones.us/2020-05-05-doom-emacs) to [[Org-Roam]] so he can \"own\" his [second brain].\n            - A key feature that he tries to accomplish is [composability] through linking, a la [[sys/Zettelkasten]]. This method of composability partially relies on effective [compression] of ideas into relatively atomic notes about key ideas, that he can then densely link with others. This partially achieves [contextualizability] as well.\n            - A key innovation in [[Org-Roam]] was the inclusion of automatic [[bi-directional links]]. Other hacker-types like [[P- Andy Matuschak]] have written scripts to do this in a more plain-text, [[Markdown]] setting like [[Bear]]\n                - [[P- Andy Matuschak]] wrote a script [[sys/note-link-janitor]] to enable [[bi-directional links]] on top of [[sys/BearNotes]], which he chooses to use because it's offline, and he also wants to experiment with building [Tools for Thought]\n            - What I want to highlight, though, is a hack that he made to provide richer [context]ualizability] links back to original sources, using [[sys/org-mode]] extension that can connect specific excerpts from PDFs to notes - each note then becomes a \"pointer\" back to a specific segment in the PDF. \n                - In his words, described in [this post](https://www.ianjones.us/org-roam-bibtex#orgb716c96) #[[@jonesOrgRoamBibtex2020]]\n                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FjsujVrXcM2.png?alt=media\u0026token=006eb7d9-e5a6-46f6-921d-ebdc3ee64980)\n        - Another example of a hacker persona (who may not personally have deep development knowledge, but can team up well with those who do) is [[P- Anne-Laure Le Cunff]]'s [Digital Garden]\n            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FRSQ8y5CSi6.png?alt=media\u0026token=0ef49845-45b1-461f-aeac-7b2d294d82a5)\n            - Built on top of [[sys/TiddlyWiki]], and inspired by [[P- Andy Matuschak]]'s approach, she also employs [[compression]] to enable richer [[[[context]]ualizability]] through [[bi-directional links]]. This particular instance, though, has less connection to primary/original sources, which is fairly typical of many of the [[Digital Garden]]s at play right now.\n            - [[P- Anne-Laure Le Cunff]] writes on Slack that most of what's needed is already in place, free and open-source: \"[[sys/TiddlyWiki]]+ [[sys/TiddlyBlink]] (for [[bi-directional links]]) + Transclude Popup Plugin for the previews (https://giffmex.org/gifts/transclusioninpopups.html) + export everything as a static website (tutorial here:¬†https://nesslabs.com/tiddlywiki-static-website-generator) and host it on GitHub pages for free.\"\n        - [[P- Stian H√•klev]] is another example: back in his PhD, he created a personal wiki to enable tighter integration between his ideas and his sources (strongly motivated by desire for [[[[context]]ualizability]])\n            - called it [[sys/researchr]], and was heavily based on a personal [[sys/Wiki]] approach, with some integrations with bibtex and PDFs. described in this video #[[@haklevUsingResearchrTagextract2012]]\n            - later migrated to [[Roam Research]] and is now core member of community. \n                - video on youtube describing the transition ([[@haklevReproducingPhDReading2019]]) was key to me getting interested enough in [[Roam Research]] to give it a real go\n        - [[sys/vim-wiki]]\n        - [[sys/GlamorousToolkit]] - not purpose-built for [[synthesis]], but very easy to do it in here, with huge advantages for [[Multiplicity]] due to its superior programmability\n        - Values\n            - openness, \"working with the garage door up\" / [[learning in public]]\n            - privacy, [[sustainability]] (not just the \"next hot tool\"), being \"future proof\" (is a big reason to work in plain text, in [[sys/emacs]] or [[std/Markdown]])\n        - Other notes\n            - Many are not scholars, but some are! Especially as the line between explorers and hackers blurs with the advent of more \"plugin-friendly\" systems like [[sys/Obsidian]] and [[Roam Research]] (in the latter, you can now write simple javascript to augment the experience; have personal experience of a law professor writing some simple javascript to visually, with some minimal semantics, distinguish source excerpts from his own thoughts)\n                - see Trick: use embedded JS to modify the DOM based on tags to make visual distinctions between my thoughts and others' thoughts.  from [[Roaman lit-reviewing meetup June 5th, 2020]]\n                - Can see these as instances of [[end-user programming]], probably not too far from the [[zone of proximal development]] for many of these researchers, especially as the lines between \"technical/programming\" work (e.g., move from SPSS to [[sys/R]]) become blurred\n                    - the [[ProgrammingHistorian]] is another example of this, as is [[Kieran Heasly]]\n                - We now also have [[sys/FoamBubble]]!!\n            - As norms move towards more [[open science]], [[open data]], digital-based workflows, and so on, there is significant opportunity to integrate with these favorable trends to explore how [[semantic publishing]] standards might be better integrated into [[scholarly workflows]]\n            - Hackers are important because they can create a more open ecosystem of tools (cf. [[sys/Athens]], [[sys/FoamBubble]], [[sys/Obsidian]]) that are easier to try. This broadens the base beyond those who are tied to a particular platform or price point.\n    - New tools we can integrate with\n        - https://twitter.com/MuseAppHQ/status/1273698452539609088\n- Comments/notes\n    - Important to be clear about what precisely we mean by [[semantic publishing]]: uptake of __what__ by __whom__, __where__\n        - Referring to: Yet, on the whole, we're not seeing nearly as much of this transformation as we'd like. Uptake of [[semantic publishing]] is low and restricted to a small set of power users\n        - What: not just linked entities, but the whole shebang: [[Atomicity]], [[context]], [[composability]], [[Multiplicity]]. IN other words, [[semantic publishing]] for [[synthesis]]! \n            - Not unique to us! see, e.g., #[[R- Genuine semantic publishing]], #[[@grozaSALTWeavingClaim2007]]\n            - Contra the slightly broader definition by #[[@shottonSemanticPublishingComing2009]]\n                - \"In the present context, I define '[[semantic publishing]]' as ^^anything that enhances the meaning of a published journal article, facilitates its automated discovery, enables its linking to semantically related articles, provides access to data within the article in actionable form, or facilitates integration of data between papers^^. Among other things, it involves enriching the article with appropriate metadata that are amenable to automated processing and analysis, allowing enhanced verifiability of published information and providing the capacity for automated discovery and summarization. These semantic enhancements increase the intrinsic value of journal articles, by increasing the ease by which information, understanding and knowledge can be extracted. They also enable the development of secondary services that can integrate information between such enhanced articles, providing additional business opportunities for the publishers involved. Equally importantly, readers benefit from more rapid, more convenient and more complete access to reliable information\" \n        - [[Katrina Fenlon]]'s review can help us provide specific, concrete examples, including things like [[std/Nanopublications]]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uI30nLzcca7gwMZ-MGXbnedk_NXFUvqVrcIpRssRz-I/edit\n    - Old/bad outline\n        - #[[Joel Chan]] 16:05 This doesn't feel right.\n        - Synthesis is a thing.\n        - It's hard.\n        - We're trying to build tools to help.\n        - Historically the focus of your work on data modeling has been on the practice of a community, or in the practice of specialized curators.

The problem: the [[Authoring Bottleneck]] for \"genuine\" [[semantic publishing]] for [[[[scholarly communication]] [[infrastructure]]]]\n        - We believe (as do you!) that [[semantic publishing]] could transform [[scholarly communication]] ([[@berners-leePublishingSemanticWeb2001]]) \n            - We resonate a lot with the vision cast by #[[@renearStrategicReadingOntologies2009]]: \"Scientists will still read narrative prose, even as text mining and automated processing become common; however, these reading practices will become increasingly strategic, supported by enhanced literature and ontology-aware tools. As part of the publishing workflow, scientific terminology will be indexed routinely against rich ontologies. More importantly, formalized assertions, perhaps maintained in specialized 'structured abstracts' (27), wil provide indexing and browsing tools with computational access to causal and ontological relationships. Hypertext linking will be extensive, generated both automatically and by readers providing commentary on blogs and through shared annotation databases. At the same time, more tools for enhanced searching, scanning and analyzing will appear and exploit the increasingly rich layer of indexing, linking, and annotation information.\" (p. 832)\n            - [[Z: Most scholarly communication infrastructure operates on the document as the base unit]]\n            - #@grozaSALTWeavingClaim2007\n        - It's not that we have made no progress! Indeed, the [[semantic publishing]] revolution is indeed underway! We see encouraging developments, in [[bioinformatics]] and [[archeology]], for example. \n        - Yet, on the whole, we're not seeing nearly as much of this transformation as we'd like. Uptake of [[semantic publishing]] is low and restricted to a small set of power users\n        - Discussion of what it will take to fully realize this transformation is robust and ongoing in this community. One important part of the conversation is a sense that  [[Z- The central bottleneck to synthesis infrastructures is authoring]]\n            - For example, [[R- Genuine semantic publishing]] notes, \"It turns out that all the technologies needed for applying genuine semantic publishing are already available and most of them are very mature and reliable. There are no __technical__ obstacles preventing us from releasing our results from today on as genuine semantic publications, even though more work is needed on ontologies that cover all relevant aspects and areas and on nice and intuitive end-user interfaces to make this process as easy as possible.\" (p. 148)\n    - ### 2. The general solution we're excited about: explore scholar-powered contribution models of [[semantic publishing]]\n        - The [[specialized [[curator]] model of semantic publishing]] is currently the engine of what uptake exists. But it requires a lot of funding, for a really long time! It's a great fit for well-funded domains like biomedical sciences, but is a much harder sell for many other domains of knowledge with less obvious funding implications, like the humanities and social sciences. And it's hard to predict in advance precisely which fields are going to be \"worth funding\": knowledge doesn't work that way!\n        - There is an exciting thread of conversation that is exploring how to address the [[Authoring Bottleneck]] with a more \"scholar-powered\" model of contribution. For example, many propose an [[author contribution model of semantic publishing]], in tandem with a [[text mining model of semantic publishing]] (#[[@monsWhichGeneDid2005]], #[[@grozaSALTWeavingClaim2007]], #[[@berners-leePublishingSemanticWeb2001]]). \n        - We think this is a promising approach! There is potential alignment of incentives, with [[semantic publishing]] providing high potential payoffs in visibility and impact of work.

Our intended contribution to this conversation: investigate integration points in existing [[scholarly workflows]] for [[synthesis]]\n        - In this paper, we want to share some preliminary findings for a foundational question: where (if at all) are there integration points in **__existing synthesis practice__** with the labor required to power synthesis infrastructures? In other words, we're investigating: ^^what (if any) [[semantic publishing]] work is already being done by scholars in their [[scholarly workflows]], not just in the authoring/publishing process^^? [[Q- What semantic publishing work is already being done by scholars in their scholarly workflows?]]\n        - Revealing these \"integration points\" would help us see where we might be able to \"accrete\" semantic authoring tools to leverage the rich semantic work that is already happening. \n        - Investigating these integration points could also help us understand how to better design \"intuitive user interfaces\" for [[authoring tools]]: beyond \"usability\", we could improve [[sustainability]] by improving, rather than disrupting, existing [[scholarly workflows]]\n        - At the same time, we could help address incentive mismatches if these integration points allow us to also significantly augment [[individual synthesis]] so that the labor of [[semantic publishing]] yields more immediate benefits.\n        - So far, we're seeing that a surprising amount of that labor is already happening! Completely of their own volition, away from any data models people, real scholars are trying to shape their workflows / setups to satisfy requirements of compression / context¬†/ composability / multiplicity.\n    - ### 4. Interlude: what do we mean by [[semantic publishing]] labor?\n        - Here is where talk about the framework of [[compression]], [[context]], [[composability]], and (maybe) [[Multiplicity]]. It's our frame for looking.\n    - ### 5.

This scene has also been heavily influenced by the idea of a [[sys/Zettelkasten]] approach for [[Knowledge Management]], originated in [[Niklas Luhmann]], and later popularized in the English-speaking world by [[zettelkasten.de]], [[S√∂nke Ahrens]] with [[@ahrensHowTakeSmart2017]], and, most recently, beginning approximately in [[2019]], by the emergence of [[Roam Research]]. There is also substantial influence from [[@andy_matuschak]], an independent researcher in the US Bay Area, who has put forward the concept of [[sys/Evergreen Notes]], and was one of the first to start sharing his. Andy himself is better understood as one of the [[Hackers]], as we will discuss in more detail.\n                        - The key practices and affordances of [[hypertext notebooks]] focus on the creation and maintenance of relatively **atomic** notes (either a concept or some kind of focused \"claim\") that are densely linked together. The links are typically accomplished through [[bi-directional links]], where, every time a link is made __from__ one source note to a target note, both the source and target notes record the link. In this way, links between notes are more accessible, since links can be followed from either source or target notes. \n                        - [[bi-directional links]] are a key innovation on top of the original [[sys/Wiki]] approach, because they enables more focused usage and labor around tending to connections between notes ([[composability]]). The links also enable [[compression]] by supporting refactoring of ideas into smaller pieces, knowing that you will still be able to follow threads of logic: users can compress quite complex ideas into a single statement (e.g., \"knowledge is contextual\") while retaining links to the less compressed ideas that \"unpack\" different aspects and subtleties of the more complex idea. In this way, tending to the notes and links also enhances the [[[[context]]ualizability]] of each note.\n                            - [[Andy's working notes]] has concept of \"layers\" in a taxonomy of [[sys/Evergreen Notes]]\n                            - See also:\n                                - #[[@saschaThreeLayersEvidence2019]]\n                                - #[[@saschaTaleComplexityStructural2018]]\n                            - [[@andy_matuschak]] wrote a script [[sys/note-link-janitor]] to enable [[bi-directional links]] on top of [[sys/BearNotes]], which he chooses to use because it's offline, and he also wants to experiment with building [[Tools for Thought]]\n                        - The system emphasizes separation between \"your thoughts\" (the main content of these networked notebooks) and \"others' thoughts\" (which should live in \"literature notes\" that are linked to, but separated from, the networked notebook) The atomicity of the notes is a way to achieve [[compression]], both obviously (by breaking things down), but also in more subtle ways, by compressing quite complex ideas into a single statement (e.g., \"knowledge is contextual\") while retaining links to the less compressed ideas that \"unpack\" the complex idea. \n                        - The atomicity and [[bi-directional links]] also emphasize the deliberate practice of [[composability]]: developing ideas into more complex and better forms over a long period of time. The phrase \"finding connections\" is a staple in this community.\n                        - Since notes that collect [[bi-directional links]] can be as \"small\" as a single concept, the act of deliberately linking notes partially accomplishes the work of deliberately developing [[folksonomies]], which approximate the more formal / [[ontologies]] work of [[semantic publishing]] for [[composability]]. A key affordance in these [[hypertext notebooks]] is that it is quite easy to rename note titles --- changes to a note's title typically automateically propagate throughout the database of notes --- which enables more agile and evolving [[ontologies]]. \n                            - People in the [[Hackers]] community are actively working on ways to manage aliases and merging. \n                                - People also use [[bi-directional links]] to do [[Contextual Bootstrapping]] of ideas, creating \"empty pages\" or \"hooks\" for concepts. \n                - ^^The hackers^^ [[Hackers]]\n                - Others??\n                    - ^^The wanderer?^^\n                        - Where many people are\n                        - Moves between many things, in constant flux\n        - Some high-level takeaways:\n            - Many of these in isolation are not new! Lots of beautifully detailed work in [[active reading]]; see as far back as #[[@oharaStudentReadersUse1998]] for rich examples, or even... as far back as [[Charles Darwin]] and, arguably, as old as external representations ;). What we see here is a different lens with which to view these data, to consider what these behaviors (could) do.\n                - The sophistication of the *system* (vs. the medium or tool) might explain [[Z: The stubborn effectiveness of analog media]]\n            - Why are they doing this?\n                - They *want* to do this work (better), but often don't because it ends up being too costly\n                - But the social context is key for at least some of it: a lot of explicit work being done in collaborative settings\n                    - Advisor meetings\n                    - Large-scale collaborations\n                    - Teams\n            - Strong opportunity for progress by partnering modeling and standards work with growing user interface innovations (sort of the reverse of making [[semantic publishing]] user interfaces better). \n                - Examples\n                    - https://twitter.com/MuseAppHQ/status/1273698452539609088\n                    - See also [[sys/Hypothes.is]]\n                - Different kinds of questions:\n                    - *which* types of annnotations at which points might be valuable __for the user__ to formalize / contextualize in some way?\n                    - how might formalisms of [[semantic publishing]] deliver immediate value to the scholar at different parts of their scholarly workflow?\n                        - identify some of the frictions and pain points in their process. good clue to this is what motivates the move to [[QDAS]] and [[sys/LiquidText]] - quotes from guided tour in [[John Thesis]]?\n                    - how much of this is actually happening? is there a way to study this in a way that is analogous to the [[cognitive surplus]] idea from crowdsourcing?\n                        - see, e.g., What is the scale at which scientists are producing annotations and notes? In other words, what is the untapped opportunity here? What is the \"drag coefficient\"? How much energy is being \"wasted'?\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:06.56060299Z","tags":null},"/R-Why-Hypothesis-Testers-Should-Spend-Less-Time-Testing-Hypotheses":{"title":"R- Why Hypothesis Testers Should Spend Less Time Testing Hypotheses","content":"\n-   #[[references]]\n    -   Title: Why Hypothesis Testers Should Spend Less Time Testing Hypotheses\n    -   Meta:\n        -   Authored by:: [[Anne M.

In response to the replication crisis, reforms in psychology have focused on formalizing procedures for testing hypotheses. These reforms were necessary and influential. However, as an unexpected consequence, psychological scientists have begun to realize that they may not be ready to test hypotheses. Forcing researchers to prematurely test hypotheses before they have established a sound \"derivation chain\" between test and theory is counterproductive. Instead, various nonconfirmatory research activities should be used to obtain the inputs necessary to make hypothesis tests informative. Before testing hypotheses, researchers should spend more time forming concepts, developing valid measures, establishing the causal relationships between concepts and the functional form of those relationships, and identifying boundary conditions and auxiliary assumptions. Providing these inputs should be recognized and incentivized as a crucial goal in itself. In this article, we discuss how shifting the focus to nonconfirmatory research can tie together many loose ends of psychology's reform movement and help us to develop strong, testable theories, as Paul Meehl urged.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:06.56060299Z","tags":null},"/R-You-cannot-play-20-questions-with-nature-and-win":{"title":"R- newellYouCanPlay1973","content":"author: \"Allen Newell\"\nyear: 1973\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:06.56060299Z","tags":null},"/R-clojureD-2021-Command-and-Conquer-Learnings-from-Decades-of-Code-Editing-by-Philippa-Markovics":{"title":"R- clojureD 2021- Command and Conquer- Learnings from Decades of Code Editing by Philippa Markovics","content":"Notes related to this talk live in the [[Nextjournal]] page.\n\n{{\u003c youtube A0TafHXszgM \u003e}}","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:06.56060299Z","tags":null},"/Readwise":{"title":"Readwise","content":"Authored by:: [[P- Brendan Langen]]\n\nReadwise is a product that allows users to extract book and journal highlights into one place.

A search bar or folder system works great in this situation.\n\nWith focused search, you know what you're looking for but not where to find it.\n\nWith exploratory search, you know where to find something but you can't quite articulate what it is you're looking for. This is what I design my digital garden for.\n\nWith exploratory browsing, people aren't searching for anything in particular, they're just consuming information.\n\nThere are two main theories of search behavior. [Information foraging theory and Berrypicking](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0165551517713168).  \n\nIt's important to think about the lens parameters: how likely is the person to know what they are looking for or where to find it? How transparent are things?\n\n## Berrypicking\n\nBerrypicking is modeled off of the author's experience picking berries on vacation. People meander from information patch to information patch, and they have many different possible search paths.\n\n**Critically, as people learn a new domain, their questions evolve.** One of the most important things for a searcher is that they learn the right questions to ask as they uncover more information.\n\n- They can store resources for later.\n- They can look into the future of an idea by seeing which papers cite it.\n- They can read the literature review and citations to see how the idea was built and where it fits into the broader landscape of the theory.\n- They can ask for help from others\n\nPeople have many different strategies for searching for information, and they flexibly switch between them as demanded by the situation.\n\n## Information Foraging Theory\n\nInformation foraging theory is more pragmatic than Berrypicking. Every search for information begins with a goal. People follow an **information scent,** which gets stronger as people approach their goal. It's almost like a hunt.  \n\nThis is based on optimal foraging theory, so people will explore a \"patch\" of information, and based on how much friction there is to move on to the next patch weighed against the probability that a patch of information contains what they're looking for, they'll move on or dive deeper.\n\nIn my hypertext notebook, I try to title my notes in such a way that there's a high **information scent** to help people determine whether to click on the link or not. I'm planning on implementing hover previews as well in order to reduce the friction to click on a page to open it up.\n\nSome extended sections of the research point to the fact that people will find information faster if they have help from others. Experts can help beginners learn the vocabulary of the domain. *For more detail, see [[R- Information Foraging Video]]*\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:06.56060299Z","tags":null},"/Semilattice":{"title":"Semilattice","content":"Authored by:: [[P- Brendan Langen]]\n\nOperating System concept design inspired by [[Roam Research]] and [[Muse]].

Iian Neill]]'s goal with [[Codex OS]] is to build a system for *relation* - the principle of relatedness or [[sensemaking]]. To achieve this, he uses a modified data structure called standoff annotation, which allows information to respect multiple interpretations. \n\nThis concept carries a ton of implications, but namely that an entity can be defined and connected in multiple locations.\n\nMost databases require an entity to carry the same relationship across the entirety of the database. This causes inherent challenges in extending knowledge across domain boundaries, as entities often carry different definitions - and thus, relationships. \n\nCodex OS is designed to enable users to frame things in multiple ways (or layers) without breaking the structure of their graph. \n\nStandoff annotation allows users to annotate atop an entity, which is stored separately from the text, yet still retains the relationship to the initial text.\nhttps://github.com/argimenes/standoff-properties-editor\n\n\u003e A standoff property is a property that 'stands off' from the text it refers to, that is stored apart from the text source.\n\u003e A property in this context is a data structure that represents a range of characters in the text along with information relevant to the annotation, such as the annotation type. Annotations can be of any type, e.g. stylistic (italics; bold; underline), semantic (line; paragraph; page), or linked entities (database record; URL).\n\n\u003e XML does not cope well with [overlapping annotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlapping_markup). This is because the tree structure of XML mandates that an overlapping annotation (two or more annotations that overlap the same text sequence) cross one or more branches of that tree structure.\n\u003e These problems disappear, however, if the text and its annotation properties are kept entirely separate. The text, then, is stored in a raw or unformatted state, annotated by a collection of discrete standoff properties.\n\nTechnical challenges from standoff properties can be mitigated by creating linked-list data structures.\n\n\u003e The technical challenge posed by standoff properties is that they require indexes to link annotations to the words in the text, which suggests that the text cannot be changed without breaking the annotations. However, by using a linked list-style structure composed of SPANs it is possible to create properties that reference characters by pointers, allowing text to be freely inserted or deleted without breaking the annotations. Indexes are only calculated at the end of the session, when the annotated text is to be exported (and presumably saved).\n\n[[P- Iian Neill]] suggests that since machine generated annotations could enable a wealth of annotations, a layering structure can act as a focusing frame. \n\n\u003e As there is no defined limit on the number or types of annotations that can be added to a text, there is the chance that texts may become visually cluttered with annotations. To address this, there is an option to assign a user-defined 'layer' to an annotation for the purpose of grouping them. Layers can be shown and hidden at will, thus reducing clutter. This is particularly helpful when it comes to computer-generated annotations, such as syntactic or semantic annotations created by an NLP library or other text analysis tools.\n\nAdding a graph database atop standoff properties affords compounding benefits.\n\n\u003e While standoff properties can be stored in any format storing them as LOD entities in a graph database vastly increases their potential. For example, if you were searching for all references to a person you would not only find the texts but the exact character positions in the text. If you expanded your query from a person like Leonardo da Vinci, say, to all artists you could see every instance an artist is mentioned in any text\n\u003e Queries could also be combined across annotation types. For example, if you had the syntax tree of a text you could find every occurence of a term within a given syntactical unit. The more annotation types you record, the greater the number of text mining options become available.\n\nSee also this thread from [[P- Iian Neill]] discussing advantages of using standoff annotation in conjunction with a graph database:\n\n- [[Twitter thread]] [[Codex OS]]: An exploration of some of the things you can do with standoff markup in Codex that you can't do in certain ... other systems.\n    - THREAD\n    - üëá [*](https://twitter.com/codexeditor/status/1302585628178051075)\n  - no `[[brackets]]` ((of)) {{any}} kind needed!\n    - no need to pick one name for your concept: just highlight the text to create/link to it\n    - no need to rename embeds later\n    - no need to define aliases\n    - find a concept not just by name but by *any term ever used to refer to it* [*](https://twitter.com/codexeditor/status/1302585629922877443)\n  - markup can intersect other markup without limit\n    - can markup inside words, single letters, even between letters\n    - markup doesn't interfere with the text, so can easily copy-paste the text without markup if desired [*](https://twitter.com/codexeditor/status/1302585631780958216)\n  - all markup linked to the user who added/changed it\n    - users can collaboratively markup without worrying about trashing the doc with clashing `[[brackets]]`\n    - AI can add its own markup without clashing\n    - easily filter markup in and out by the user, by type, by properties [*](https://twitter.com/codexeditor/status/1302585633546747905)\n  - marking up text creates any kind of entity you like in the graph, not just pages or text blocks\n    - graph entities can have properties, traits, user-defined relationships, be linked to activities\n    - you define entities from the bottom up from your texts [*](https://twitter.com/codexeditor/status/1302585635421564928)\n  - markup is basically handled like a web component: it's not just data, it can also have behaviours, life cycle\n    - markup can call out to APIs\n    - markup can be self-animating #NoCode: no JS or CSS needed, just click a button/hit a key [*](https://twitter.com/codexeditor/status/1302588233310588930)\n  - markup not stored as HTML embedded in text so poses no XSS risk\n    - new markup can be easily written in the API, from simple styling, to animation, to semantic links to the knowledge graph\n    - markup links entities and texts in the graph together into one giant transclusive web [*](https://twitter.com/codexeditor/status/1302588235613310979)\n  - pick a concept (like \"markup\") and see all *other* concepts mentioned in any lines in your graph where \"markup\" appears - in less than a second\n    - pick a concept and find all lines where all things *related to that concept* appear\n    - did I mention you can define relationships?

See [[C- Hypertext enables communication with high information density]] for more details. Autocomplete supports this use case, augmenting \"tip of my tongue\" recall.\n\n### Linking \n\nPeople would connect multiple concepts together, providing themselves navigational or semantic relationships. In the case [[Roam Research]], naming, categorization, chronology, pipeline, and description are all collapsed into links.\n\nNot all links are created equal. For example, most networked notebook software simply enables users to say that two items are related without the ability to label the relationship, providing a reason **why** they are related. By displaying [[contextual backlinks]], the user can view the relationship in the context of a sentence or paragraph without requiring additional organizational overhead in requiring the user to explicitly label relationships.\n\nAdditionally, links between two nodes gain a higher degree of fidelity when the nodes have types. For example, [[P- Joel Chan]]'s [[Discourse Graph Plugin]] gives you claims, questions, evidence, and sources by default, while enabling the user to create their own types, such as decisions, ideas, and people. Simply being able to filter relationships by node type implies a lot of meaning. For example, claims related to a decision likely support arguments on either side, and evidence related to a claim likely supports or opposes the claim.\n\nLinks can also vary in whether they are directed or undirected. For example, A --leads to--\u003e C, or A \u003c-is friends with-\u003e B. Most networked notebooks primarily support undirected links.\n\n### Categorization\n\nThis is when the user places items into classes or groups. This can happen in a bottom up manner through [affinity mapping](https://www.usertesting.com/blog/affinity-mapping), where users would take previously uncategorized information, place it into groups of similar content, and then name the groups. It can also happen top down, where people would come up with types of note (like claims, questions, and resources).\n\n### Description\n\nThis is typically a more bottoms up process than categorization, where things are defined in terms of how they are described, Then, when users want to pull up a note but can't remember the title of the note, they describe it and see what's similar. This is very similar to how people might recall an item when it's on the \"tip of their tongue.\" In conjunction with labeled relationships, this can be a very effective strategy. For example, \"I know there was a paper **about** psychological responses to sudden windfalls **by** a specific author.\" With labeled relationships, this sort of query would be trivial.\n\n### Logical rules\n\nThis includes equivalence statements like \"X is the same as Y,\" encompassing statements like \"X contains Y,\" or conditional statements like \"If X or Y, then Z.\"\n\nSome apps, like [[Obsidian]], [[LogSeq]], and [[Codex OS]], enable aliases, which can be thought of similarly to an equivalence statement, but are not quite the same thing. These enable you to refer to a single concept in multiple ways, but do not enable you to refer to one concept or the other and have references show up in both, like [[I- Provide Push and Pull as inline syntax to affect the related items section for a page|push and pull do in Agora]].\n\nEncompassing statements are available in some sense with applications like [[LogSeq]] and [[Bear]] that enable hierarchical namespacing. For example, in LogSeq, I might refer to specific applications as or Here I'm referring to something like \"any time I refer to Perceptual Control Theory, I'm also referring to Behavioral Science Theories generally, but not the other way around.\n\n[[Roam Research]] similarly enables encompassing statements through nested page titles - for example, `[[I- A [[structural editor]] for [[data structures]]]]` would reference both `[[structural editor]]` and `[[data structures]]` every time the encompassing page title was referenced. One might argue that this is more flexible than LogSeq's namespacing approach, as it does not scope either of the nested pages into one strict hierarchy.\n\n### Pipeline\n\nThis is when users specify different stages in a pipeline where a note can live. In the traditional [[Zettelkasten]] practice, there are fleeting notes and permanent notes. In [[P- Maggie Appleton]]'s variation of [[P- Andy Matuschak]]'s system, [notes are \"seedlings\" before they develop into \"evergreen.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXXXHN516qc) In my personal writing pipeline, I have [premise, develop, and publish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2To62BcMdI). See also: [[C- People process complex information in multiple levels and stages of processing]]\n\n### Location\n\nThis can be seen in apps that use folders or outliners that use indentation to signify hierarchy. \"Which folder does this idea go into?\" \"What should I indent this under?\" We saw multiple users concerned with [[quick capture]] complain that \"[[If I‚Äôm thinking too hard about structure before I write the note, I forget what I was going to write down]].\"\n\n### Chronology\n\n[[Roam Research]] is opinionated insofar as it starts all users on the \"Daily Notes Page\" when they load the app. If all other forms of organization fail, users may still be able to find what they are looking for based on which day they wrote about it.","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T19:14:06.56060299Z","tags":null},"/TheBrain":{"title":"TheBrain","content":"Authored by:: [[P- Brendan Langen]]\n\nThis video gives a basic intro to TheBrain.

It all started out with a lightweight search UI, so that I could seamlessly search through tweets to reference while I was writing new threads, weaving together old ideas with new ones. Then I added a way to see people's best tweets, so I could get more from coming across an interesting user's profile.\n\u003e I used this extension myself for about 6 months, and after a while I couldn't live without it.

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik).

It produces results that *exactly* match the search query. This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://beta.operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\n3. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\n4. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\n6. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true`, `operandApiKey` to your copied key, and `operandIndexId` to the ID of the index we created from earlier..\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nsearch:\n  enableSemanticSearch: true\n  operandApiKey: \"jp9k5hudse2a828z98kxd6z3payi8u90rnjf\"\n  operandIndexId: \"s0kf3bd6tldw\"\n```\n7. Push your changes to the site and wait for it to deploy.\n8. Check the Operand dashboard and wait for your site to index.
