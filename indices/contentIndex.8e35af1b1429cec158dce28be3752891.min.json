[*](((ozwR1UaGD)))\n    - Adding structure later is a viable alternative, as people likely have a better idea of how their current idea fits into the wider whole. But, we frequently heard that the act of adding structure later **feels like a chore**. \n    - This showed up when people described processing reading notes, refining old ideas, or managing their queue of work. The idea of a queue of work showed up in many interviews, in a variety of forms.  People would create indexes, pages of TODOs, resource lists, pipelines, areas to review flashcards, or tagged items to return to later. \n    - Ideas were even processed through a queue in certain notebooks, with different stages of an idea categorized (fleeting, literature note, evergreen, etc.) or labeled in a pipeline (premise, develop, completed, etc.).  Some queues were managed specifically, with a spaced repetition algorithm prompting them to return to a prior block.  Others were less formally organized, and people returned to them as a regular, unscheduled part of their work.\n    - A common failure mode for queues was to process the same list multiple times.  For example, someone might look through an inbox of ideas, find the best ones, and then move those over into another list. Then, a month later, they would look through the inbox again, repeating the process.  The problem is that it was difficult to distinguish which ideas they had already processed, so they would repeat the work of screening through ideas they had already screened out. We can see systems like [Allen Wilson's](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/playing-zettelkasten-rpg-through-arbitrary-constraints/) evolve to prevent this repeat work.\n    - One interviewee went as far as mentioning avoiding the tasks they created to review old notes. Others mentioned reviewing notes felt like repeat effort [*](). \n    - While queue processing can be extremely effective to those who have internalized the practice, it was done by very few of our interviewees.\n    - For more, see: [C- Current tools do not support flexible exploration and refactoring of structures as they inevitably evolve](C-%20Current%20tools%20do%20not%20support%20flexible%20exploration%20and%20refactoring%20of%20structures%20as%20they%20inevitably%20evolve.md).[*](((Lrk1wY9wE)))\n    - tl;dr summary\n        - Existing structural systems are often seen by people as a chore. Existing queue management systems are too tedious. The story is clear ‚Äì most people don't want to spend time refactoring notes. That feels like [wasted repeated effort](wasted%20repeated%20effort).\n        - People may decide not to regularly return to past ideas, which will enable them to stay in flow of their current work. Provided the note can stand on its own, or they don‚Äôt need to add on, this quick capture ‚Äúset it and forget it‚Äù can be fine. \n        - Problems arise when we want to reuse these old ideas. Inevitably the noise in our notebooks is too loud to find the signal we‚Äôre looking for. Creating queues of work to return to later feels like a chore, and our tools don‚Äôt help us resolve this.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-04-20T22:17:47.824173357Z","tags":null},"/Migrated/C-Current-tools-do-not-support-flexible-exploration-and-refactoring-of-structures-as-they-inevitably-evolve":{"title":"Untitled Page","content":"\n---\ntitle: \"C- Current tools do not support flexible exploration and refactoring of structures as they inevitably evolve\"\nenableToc: false # do not show a table of contents on this page\n---\nFirst draft:\n    - Predefining a system limits our ability to explore alternatives outside the current structure.  This cascades into the decisions to be made while in the act of work ‚Äì what folder to place the note in, what naming conventions to use, what metadata should be added, and on.  \n    - When something doesn't feel like it fits into a pre-existing structure, participants would feel stressed out. This happens frequently while exploring a new domain of knowledge, as people don‚Äôt yet know what the most useful schema will be. People also like to change their schemas as their skill with a thought processor increases and they learn more optimal paths.\n    - A simple, practical example: \n    - Imagine you have a template for each book you read, but you want to add additional attributes later. Updating your template is nice, but it doesn't highlight what's missing from current files. This creates more work for yourself whenever you want to make an update!\n    - In note writing tools like Obsidian and Athens, adding this new metadata to instances of the template in hindsight is entirely manual.  [It's hard to change structure later](It's%20hard%20to%20change%20structure%20later). In a relational database like Notion or Airtable, the process is a little easier: add a new column to the table and filter or apply conditional formatting for empty fields.\n    - Of course, done correctly, this structure can also enable easier reuse of past thoughts and the sharing of ideas with others. As we‚Äôve discussed, structure is not a bad thing! However, the limitations of predefining structure are worth noting. Choosing not to define consistent attributes, or simply using implicit structure in notes, allows for flexibility in our thought process and preserves optionality.  On the downside, this limits our ability for rich querying and flexibility of ‚Äúviews‚Äù down the road. Then we have to rely on our calcified memory of attributes to refactor our work. \n    - If we want structure in our notes, our current tools require that we explicitly add it, in the form of names, placement or attributes. Certain sorts of structure are more rigid than others. For example, open ended metadata enabled email to be expanded into new use cases.\n    - \u003e¬†You can add any headers you like. This makes the set of headers an open set, enabling new use-cases to evolve from the bottom-up. Want to record the title, author, and publish date of your books? Add some headers. Want to include a location? Add a header.¬†\n\n[P- Gordon Brander](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/People/P-%20Gordon%20Brander.md) [If headers did not exist, it would be necessary to invent them](https://subconscious.substack.com/p/if-headers-did-not-exist-it-would)\n    - Also, whether there are multiple paths to the data is important.  For example, someone using Roam might be more comfortable throwing many types of structure at the wall because they know if one system fails to resurface a note¬†they likely have a fallback. In a file / folder system like Evernote, the folder location of a note matters much more because search is your only fallback if you don't remember which folder a note was in.

This facilitates easy navigation where people are able to find what they are looking for [even when they don't quite know how to express](https://twitter.com/RobertHaisfield/status/1265306759356223493?s=20) it.\n- As Andy [likes to say in \"Evergreen Note Titles are like APIs\"](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_note_titles_are_like_APIs): [*](((94z1iNd0D)))\n\t- \u003e When [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C) are factored and titled well, those titles become an abstraction for the note itself. The entire note‚Äôs ideas can then be referenced using that handle (see [Concept handles, after Alexander](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5vA4vw86DKNq22xt6pRWhumeRmSzwV6hxRHE)). In fact, this property itself functions as a kind of litmus: as you develops ideas in notes over time and improve the ‚ÄúAPIs,‚Äù you‚Äôll be able to write individual notes which abstract over increasingly large subtrees (e.g. [Enacted experiences have incredible potential as a mass medium](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6oXuXLZ7Wq1eBqskyfph2wz9gjohQUKSBFzx), [Evergreen note-writing as fundamental unit of knowledge work](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3SjnvsB5aR2ddsycyXofbYR7fCxo7RmKW2be)). ^ee42bf\n- When the title of the note is able to subsitute for the whole idea, it compresses a large amount of knowledge into a sentence, allowing knowledge workers to create a shorthand supported by autocomplete wikilinks. Through bidirectional linking, those wikilinks also create a collection of relevant material. [*](((YnjoPGwZt)))\n- Hypertext structured in this manner is excellent for exploratory search. When people read a page they do not fully understand, hyperlinks will take them to the pages that explain component concepts, recursively, until they have learned what they need to know to grasp the original page. This style of search is efficient, because if people already understand a concept, they do not need to pursue the links further.\n- When you have read much of a person's work in a well structured hypertext notebook, you can build a rich mental model of their thinking. I've read so much by [P- Tom Critchlow](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/People/P-%20Tom%20Critchlow.md) that, when I read a 6 tweet long twitter thread, I am able to connect it to his [bigger worldview](https://twitter.com/RobertHaisfield/status/1418236841275183111) and even simulate conversations with him. This is because hypertext writing is information dense and refers to sets of ideas in consistent ways. Given that our goal is to combine knowledge at a large scale, information density is crucial.\n- If a key challenge of decentralized synthesis is bringing people up to speed, then hypertext is a promising direction.\n","lastmodified":"2022-04-20T22:17:47.824173357Z","tags":null},"/Migrated/C-Linked-references-are-a-smart-default-for-related-items":{"title":"Untitled Page","content":"\n---\ntitle: \"C- Linked references are a smart default for related items\"\nenableToc: false # do not show a table of contents on this page\n---\n- Assuming you're not using aliases, a plain text search in [Obsidian](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/Tools%20for%20Thought%20Examples/Obsidian.md) for `\"[page](page)\"` within quotations is functionally indistinguishable from the backlinks for that page. Linked references can then be thought of as a search for related items, where all the app knows is that backlinks have a high likelihood of being related because the user explicitly linked the items together.\n- Unlinked references can be thought of as a search for `\"page\" -\"[page](page)`. These have a lower likelihood of relatedness, as the connections were not explicitly made by the author while writing, but may represent latent connections in imported text or [quick capture](quick%20capture) thoughts. Linking unlinked references is tool for [structure in hindsight](../LitReview/structure%20in%20hindsight.md)\n- If we [I- Populate the related items section through a search term](I-%20Populate%20the%20related%20items%20section%20through%20a%20search%20term.md), there needs to be a smart default term, as requiring the user to manually specify a search to represent related items for each page would be too much work. As wikilink matches are high signal, `[page](page)` should be the default term. That will often be enough. However, if it isn't, the user should be able to adjust the search term to more accurately express what they consider to be related.\n- [P- Gordon Brander](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/People/P-%20Gordon%20Brander.md) made a similar point, taking inspiration from [Notational Velocity](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/Tools%20for%20Thought%20Examples/Notational%20Velocity.md). As he phrases it in [Search reveals useful dimensions in latent idea space](https://subconscious.substack.com/p/search-reveals-useful-dimensions):\n- \u003e **Any sufficiently advanced search is indistinguishable from a hyperlink**.

Knowledge evolves over time, and we adapt our thoughts as we see other perspectives. This is the [sensemaking](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/Terms/sensemaking.md) process. This is our introduction to something new, and we know the least we ever will about the topic at this time. \n- Similarly, in the moment a note is created, it is very difficult to know where it __belongs__. We may not yet have a name for what we're seeing or know how it relates to another insight. Our understanding will likely evolve after reading other sources. On later review, we may even find a unique detail of the wider point to be the most interesting. It's hard to know everything up front! \n- [C- Sensemaking requires iterative loops of (re)interpreting data in light of evolving schemas](C-%20Sensemaking%20requires%20iterative%20loops%20of%20(re)interpreting%20data%20in%20light%20of%20evolving%20schemas). The primary models that represent this process are the [Learning Loop Complex](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/Terms/Learning%20Loop%20Complex.md) and the [Notional Model of Sensemaking](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/Terms/Notional%20Model%20of%20Sensemaking.md), which loops between and within foraging and sensemaking loops, progressively increasing in structure and effort, starting from raw data sources and culminating in a synthesized set of hypotheses. \n- In our interviews, we saw multiple people talk about their process of [conversations, chats with others](conversations,%20chats%20with%20others) to crystallize new information, like [R16](R16) in their synthesis process. Sometimes this can be a frame, or a prompt, that the person presented to themselves, like [R10](R10) writing multiple versions in order to speak fluently about the topic. \n- This all speaks to the need to treat notes as a work in progress. Notes aren't in their final form when first written; they evolve, often far beyond the stub they began as. Translating to tool design, [C- There needs to be an excellent workflow for refactoring in a tool for thought](C-%20There%20needs%20to%20be%20an%20excellent%20workflow%20for%20refactoring%20in%20a%20tool%20for%20thought) to enable [incremental formalization](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/Terms/incremental%20formalization.md).\n- In the scope of a [Thought processor](Thought%20processor), we see different approaches. [Roam](Roam) encourages users to write directly into a daily notes page, linking to pages as they write. This contrasted conventional practice in tools like Evernote that ask the user to name the page and place it in a folder up front. Zettelkasten systems, which are agnostic to a specific tool, ask users to create a note without names and later fit it in next to similar notes.\n- In the process of synthesis, we often write a number of notes about an idea - some useful, some not. We know that [C- Multiplicity is necessary for synthesis](C-%20Multiplicity%20is%20necessary%20for%20synthesis), and this writing process helps, but it creates a huge amount of noise for us to later search through. We have a need for Archiving.\n- Forgetting is powerful. If something is no longer important, its presence in your memory is a burden, turning your \"search results\" into a noisy mess that decreases your likelihood of finding the right answer.\n- Many people use personal knowledge management software to augment their memories. \"Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them\" as stated in the infamous productivity text \"Getting Things Done.\" We saw this again and again in our interviews. Expert synthesizers use thought processors to ensure good ideas don't fall through the cracks. Personally, I use thought processors in conjunction with personal knowledge management in order to ensure the lessons I learn today retain their usefulness in 10 years. If at that point my questions and ideas are dependent on recent memory rather than a decade of learning, I've failed.\n- However, over the course of 1 year using Obsidian, I wrote more than a million words. Maybe 30% of that was from educational materials. The rest was \"thinking out loud\" in order to process thoughts. Eventually, many of those thoughts would be processed into an information artifact. Those artifacts became my canonical point of reference. [*](((oYOFV-9b_)))\n- While this multiplicity is generally useful during the process of thinking through an issue, later down the line reviewing it contributes to the feeling of [wasted repeated effort](wasted%20repeated%20effort). Early versions of information in the final artifact can likely be forgotten without much negative consequence.[*](((ULqBmEu14)))\n- Additionally, over the course of a decade, I'll certainly update my beliefs and mental models. If that happens, I'll have to ask myself, \"Is it important to keep a record of my beliefs at that point in time, or is leaving it in my database weighing it down?\"\n- I don't know how software can automatically archive this information without making users mad at some point or another. This is a hard problem, but it should be clear that [C- Bulk refactors are a necessary primitive to maintaining a decentralized discourse graph](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/WIP/C-%20Bulk%20refactors%20are%20a%20necessary%20primitive%20to%20maintaining%20a%20decentralized%20discourse%20graph.md).\n- At the extreme end, Venkatesh Rao jokingly referred to an archetype of user as [\"mind-palace pack rats\"](https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1370583027512872961). These are the people who don't know how to delete information and want to either memorize or save all information they encounter. I occasionally fall into this trap. [C- Predicting trajectories of future reuse of information objects is hard](C-%20Predicting%20trajectories%20of%20future%20reuse%20of%20information%20objects%20is%20hard), and information hoarders may believe that everything will be reused at some point. Additionally, they may believe that it's better to have information and not need it than need it and not have it.\n- Whether or not either of these beliefs turn out to be true, the hoarders will produce a massive amount of information over the course of 10 years. \n- If the first belief is false and they never delete or archive information, then this means they will have too much information to search through in 10 years, turning their personal database into a noisy mess with far too much to sift through for efficient reuse. Whether or not the second belief is true, it must be weighed against the immense cost of bloating your knowledge graph.\n- The problem is that over the course of 10 years, I'll generate so much content that many of it will simply appear to be noise. Not everything you believe to be important today will be important then. Most likely, you will only want the most important artifacts due to time constraints.\n","lastmodified":"2022-04-20T22:17:47.824173357Z","tags":null},"/Migrated/I-Enable-composable-queries-to-facilitate-structure-in-hindsight":{"title":"Untitled Page","content":"\n---\ntitle: \"I- Enable composable queries to facilitate structure in hindsight\"\nenableToc: false # do not show a table of contents on this page\n---\n- [If a page's related items section is defined through a search term]([I- Populate the related items section through a search term](I-%20Populate%20the%20related%20items%20section%20through%20a%20search%20term.md)), then we can think of the page title and its query as a key-value pair.

We would frequently see people create multiple pages that mean the same thing simply because their body of notes had grown so large that they didn't remember they had already created other pages to refer to the same concept. \n- This is a huge challenge of adding structure! In our private research notebook, we refer to this problem of entropy from structure in multiple ways (for example, `[Q- How might we prevent workflow entropy](Q-%20How%20might%20we%20prevent%20workflow%20entropy)` and `[[[I- Enable composable queries to reduce system entropy](%5B%5BI-%20Enable%20composable%20queries%20to%20reduce%20system%20entropy)]]`).\n- We aim to [work at the speed of thought](work%20at%20the%20speed%20of%20thought), but too much structure creates paralyzing cognitive overhead.

This affordance aims to solve issues where users have created multiple pages for similar ideas, but the results are different in practice. When two pages represent conceptually \"close\" concepts, users consistently link blocks to both pages to ensure linked references show up on each page. Merging is not always appropriate.\n- Over time, these duplicate links pile up, and users feel the need to link to a large vocabulary of pages, which brings us back to square one with [Repeat work](Repeat%20work). Their system's surface area has greatly increased in size, and they're reliant on their own memory to recall each new link they add. Ultimately, this leads to system collapse or abandonment.  \n- Multiplayer amplifies the problem, [as different people refer to similar concepts with different language]([Q- How do we solve the problem of different people referring to the same concept with different language](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/Q-%20How%20do%20we%20solve%20the%20problem%20of%20different%20people%20referring%20to%20the%20same%20concept%20with%20different%20language.md)).\n- Composable queries enable people to create both aliases and hierarchies.

We suspect this will reduce system entropy over time.\n- Given that search terms can be defined to bring in a broader array of stuff than a simple list of backlinks, users will require a way to filter their results.

In essence, this enables you to create organization systems now to capture knowledge in the future.\n    - However, search terms alone are not sufficient. People do not always know how to express what they are looking for. In that case, we have exploratory search and browsing *(see [Search Behavior](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/Search%20Behavior.md)).* They will need navigational aids as well.\n    - Wikis are one such navigational aid. [Through hypertext](https://robhaisfield.com/notes/writing-in-hypertext), wikis enable people to seamlessly jump from page to page. People often compete in [Wikiraces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikirace) where they have to go from a random article to a specific one as quickly as they can by only clicking on hyperlinks. These have become even more popular lately in [digital gardens](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden). Some examples include [P- Andy Matuschak](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/People/P-%20Andy%20Matuschak.md)'s [working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes), my personal public [hypertext notebook](https://robhaisfield.com/about), and a more recent [academic literature review example by Matt Clancy](https://www.newthingsunderthesun.com/about) on innovation economics.\n    - Bidirectional links are another aid. As stated by [P- Andy Matuschak](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/People/P-%20Andy%20Matuschak.md):\n    - \u003e Systems which display backlinks to a node permit a new behavior: you can define a new node extensionally (rather than intensionally) by simply linking to it from many other nodes‚Äîeven before it has any content.\n    - \u003e ...\n    - \u003e This effect requires [Contextual backlinks](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3RzQhmjeRxXVAAy81aUSKARwJL8dikdJG4VG): a simple list of backlinks won‚Äôt implicitly define a node very effectively. You need to be able to see the context around the backlink to understand what‚Äôs being implied.\n    - ^da790c\n    - Look at this screenshot. I knew I was looking for something related to \"contextual backlinks,\" so after finding that on google, I was was able to look through the backlinks and find the page that I was looking for: [\"Backlinks can be used to implicitly define nodes in knowledge management systems.\"](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Contextual_backlinks?stackedNotes=z2newCwFfd6iZFyf9bgspkbyt1G8wbQxJVgTK) The backlinks themselves are contextual. They don't just show the page that a phrase is connected to, but also the paragraph that it was linked in.\n    - Andy Matuschak's working notes, like a wiki, use hypertext to communicate in an information dense way. This facilitates easy navigation where people are able to find what they are looking for [even when they don't quite know how to express](https://twitter.com/RobertHaisfield/status/1265306759356223493?s=20) it.\n    - ![Pasted image 20210913163109](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/Resources/Pasted%20image%2020210913163109.png)\n    - Matuschak adds an additional navigation layer to the UX of the wiki- when you click on a link in the page to the left, it opens that up to the right. This gives the effect of a book that rearranges its pages for you based on your present curiosity. One idea I've designed is to expand that out into 2D navigation, where people lay out the tiles, as seen in this working Figma file (https://www.figma.com/file/kHLDEecCMvZAIDnfe95tmp/graph-research-visual-inspo?node-id=0%3A1).\n    - The signal/noise ratio is a very big problem when it comes to exploratory search or browsing. The natural inclination is to broaden a search term so people don't have to specifically express what they are looking for. However, in a decentralized discourse graph, you need to deal with the problem of quantity. If you have thousands of pages worth of information in a graph with many contributors, broadening the search will show you too many results.\n    - As I mentioned earlier, [C- Search terms express intentions](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/C-%20Search%20terms%20express%20intentions.md). However, not all search results will be relevant to your present intention. [C- People need a way of promoting and demoting knowledge in a decentralized knowledge graph](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/WIP/C-%20People%20need%20a%20way%20of%20promoting%20and%20demoting%20knowledge%20in%20a%20decentralized%20knowledge%20graph.md). In the context of a search, [C- Highlighted and lowlighted search results map to how well results map to intentions](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/C-%20Highlighted%20and%20lowlighted%20search%20results%20map%20to%20how%20well%20results%20map%20to%20intentions.md). Highlighting and lowlighting could come in other forms, such as [quadratic voting](https://twitter.com/metamitya/status/1248768114768084994?s=20), utilized in [Knovigator](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/Tools%20for%20Thought%20Examples/Knovigator.md).\n    - [C- People are lazy](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/C-%20People%20are%20lazy.md). This is one of the key barriers to creating a semantic web, so user work that could add meaningful metadata should not be wasted. In asking [Q- What is the data structure of a graph built to facilitate decentralized knowledge synthesis](../LitReview/Main/Q-%20What%20is%20the%20data%20structure%20of%20a%20graph%20built%20to%20facilitate%20decentralized%20knowledge%20synthesis.md), we should note that if the data structure is able to take into account searches, search results, and quality signals, then the result discourse graph structure is fairly semantic. Perhaps the information from these searches could inform the ranking of items in future searches, and what is considered related content. This can itself be seen as a form of incremental formalization.\n    - It's important to ask [Q- What changes in a discourse graph as quantity of content increases](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/Q-%20What%20changes%20in%20a%20discourse%20graph%20as%20quantity%20of%20content%20increases.md): for example, it is common for Roam's new users to excitedly claim: \"Roam's organization gets better as you write more!\" However, [reverse entropy requires specific patterns of user behavior](https://twitter.com/RobertHaisfield/status/1259504520830136320) and is not a given. By using outlines as a data entry interface for their knowledge graph, they encourage patterns of divergent creativity. At its worse, this can lead you with so much information that it feels impossible to bring it all together.\n    - People need an interface for convergence as well. [P- Joel Chan](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/People/P-%20Joel%20Chan.md) writes about this as [incremental formalization](https://roambrain.com/knowledge-synthesis/). [Incrementally processing notes is a key user behavior to promote synthesis](../LitReview/Main/C-%20Incrementally%20processing%20notes%20is%20a%20key%20user%20behavior%20to%20promote%20synthesis.md). In doing so, they progressively compress large amounts of information into smaller amounts, which allows people to more easily compose ideas and define their relationships. Writing in hypertext allows people to have an incredible amount of information density. As Andy Matuschak [likes to say](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_note_titles_are_like_APIs):\n    - \u003e When [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C) are factored and titled well, those titles become an abstraction for the note itself. The entire note‚Äôs ideas can then be referenced using that handle (see [Concept handles, after Alexander](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5vA4vw86DKNq22xt6pRWhumeRmSzwV6hxRHE)). In fact, this property itself functions as a kind of litmus: as you develops ideas in notes over time and improve the ‚ÄúAPIs,‚Äù you‚Äôll be able to write individual notes which abstract over increasingly large subtrees (e.g. [Enacted experiences have incredible potential as a mass medium](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6oXuXLZ7Wq1eBqskyfph2wz9gjohQUKSBFzx), [Evergreen note-writing as fundamental unit of knowledge work](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3SjnvsB5aR2ddsycyXofbYR7fCxo7RmKW2be)). ^ee42bf\n    - When you have read much of a person's work in a well structured hypertext notebook, you can build a rich mental model of their thinking. I've read so much by [P- Tom Critchlow](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/People/P-%20Tom%20Critchlow.md) that, when I read a 6 tweet long twitter thread, I am able to connect it to his [bigger worldview](https://twitter.com/RobertHaisfield/status/1418236841275183111) and even simulate conversations with him. This is because hypertext writing is information dense and refers to sets of ideas in consistent ways. Given that our goal is to combine knowledge at a large scale, information density is crucial.\n    - We have also seen summarization as a way to compress information. [Wikum](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/Tools%20for%20Thought%20Examples/Wikum.md) [allows]((http://wikum.csail.mit.edu/)) its users to summarize groups of comments in a Hacker News or Reddit like forum. Summaries can be built on other summaries, allowing people to zoom out and see what a discussion was about at a high level before going into the weeds to read each comment. This demonstrates the need for a [Zoomable User Interface](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/Terms/ZUI.md). *See [C- An ideal decentralized discourse graph would enable people to view information at different levels of granularity through a ZUI](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/WIP/C-%20An%20ideal%20decentralized%20discourse%20graph%20would%20enable%20people%20to%20view%20information%20at%20different%20levels%20of%20granularity%20through%20a%20ZUI.md)*\n    - ![Pasted image 20210913173741](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/Resources/Pasted%20image%2020210913173741.png)\n- Publish in notebook:\n    - [I- Replace the backlinks section of a page with a related items section](I-%20Replace%20the%20backlinks%20section%20of%20a%20page%20with%20a%20related%20items%20section.md)\n    - [I- Use search terms as the basis for other features](I-%20Use%20search%20terms%20as%20the%20basis%20for%20other%20features.md)\n        - [I- Utilize search terms as the basis for user-defined notifications](I-%20Utilize%20search%20terms%20as%20the%20basis%20for%20user-defined%20notifications.md)\n        - [I- Utilize search terms as the basis for user-defined subscriptions](I-%20Utilize%20search%20terms%20as%20the%20basis%20for%20user-defined%20subscriptions.md)\n- Draft: index page route\n- [I- Search as a part of the primitive design](.md) [outline](outline)\n    - In the [structure now vs. later (uncertain payoff, regret)](structure%20now%20vs.%20later%20(uncertain%20payoff,%20regret)) tradeoff, people tend to [defer structuring until later]([Why people prefer to structure later or not at all](Why%20people%20prefer%20to%20structure%20later%20or%20not%20at%20all)) or not structure at all.

Its primary problem is that it requires the user to manually visit the location of the queries. The main adjustment would be to ping the user when a new item enters the unseen query. Roam users have hacked around this by writing plugins that would ping them on Slack whenever there was a new mention.\n- From a [primitive design](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/Terms/primitive%20design.md) perspective, users would need the ability to set up automations, to include \"new result enters query\" as a trigger, and \"send notification\" as an action.

Further, if someone has a system already in place in another tool, the opportunity cost to migrate their structure is high.\n    - Ultimately, this comes down to the fact that people are different, and the stage of work we‚Äôre in drives the tools we want to use. Some of us want a zoomable canvas. Others want an outliner. Even more of us want to move between these interfaces and a blank page structure, depending on what the current task demands of us. We operate in different contexts over different stages of work, and while our tools are moving towards flexible interfaces, there is still too much of a one-size-fits-all approach in current user interfaces.\n    - Expert users tend to prefer tools that either share their opinion or are neutral enough to enable them to impose their opinion onto the tool, and not vice versa.\n","lastmodified":"2022-04-20T22:17:47.824173357Z","tags":null},"/Migrated/If-Im-thinking-too-hard-about-structure-before-I-write-the-note-I-forget-what-I-was-going-to-write-down":{"title":"Untitled Page","content":"\n---\ntitle: \"If I‚Äôm thinking too hard about structure before I write the note, I forget what I was going to write down\"\nenableToc: false # do not show a table of contents on this page\n---\n- The title says it all.

As people are looking through the results of a query, they might right click then select the option: \"remove from query.\" The menu path might look like the following, where each of the topics could be toggled:\n    - ```clojure\n{:remove {:itemID sladfkji4af4sdkf\n          :author \"John Doe\"\n          :topic-mentioned [\"topic1\"\n                            \"topic2\"\n                            \"topic3\"]}}```\n- When people click on an \"x\" on the query result's item, the smart default could be to remove that block's UID from the query through `(not (any: uid1 uid2))`.\n- Imagine \"economic inflation\" were a topic mentioned in an item within your newsfeed query and you right clicked to remove that topic. This might translate into the following:\n- ```clojure\n(def muted-topics-list\n  (any: \"economic inflation\"\n        \"veganism\"))\n(def muted-items-list\n  (any: uid1\n        uid2))\n(def newsfeed\n  (any: followed-people\n        followed-interests)\n  (not: (any: muted-authors-list\n              muted-topics-list\n              muted-items-list)))```\n- Alternatively, users might process the list of query results through highlighting and lowlighting. [C- Highlighted and lowlighted search results map to how well results map to intentions](../LitReview/Extended%20Universe/C-%20Highlighted%20and%20lowlighted%20search%20results%20map%20to%20how%20well%20results%20map%20to%20intentions.md), so the default assumption could be that lowlighting a block would remove that block from the query results. A block id would then have a `queries-where-highlighted` and `queries-where-lowlighted` property, listing the relevant queries.\n- It's possible that users don't always want to reify an entirely new query as an entity, and sometimes would like to simply filter a query.

[*](((9hBW8bOFa)))\n- In current tools, structuring ideas in real-time is an extraneous task that __takes you out of the flow of the work__ you're doing. Often, people don't even know how to predict how they will reuse the note in the future! Deciding what to name something in the moment has a cost; people are removed from the current train of thought. In a file-folder format, deciding where to place a note adds another layer of friction. This occurs again when trying to retrieve past thoughts through search or block references.\n- If people have already developed elaborate systems, then the requirement to structure as you go can feel restrictive and stressful. For example, if I'm on my phone and want to capture an idea, but I have a highly structured system, then it will simply take longer to navigate to the correct locations and link to the correct pages because I went from 10 fingers to 2 thumbs.\n- If a tool doesn't have a great mobile version, this problem is exacerbated. We frequently heard from our interviews that quick capture of an idea on the go was vital to their process. If a tool doesn't have a great mobile version, this problem is exacerbated. We frequently heard from our interviews that quick capture of an idea on the go was vital to their process.\n- Because [structuring notes in the moment is costly]([It takes too much work to create structure](It%20takes%20too%20much%20work%20to%20create%20structure)), the design implications are that thought processors should either lower the cost of structuring or give users the ability to structure in hindsight.\n- Those who avoid explicitly collating and naming ideas can work at the speed of thought and avoid premature convergence. They may prefer to specify relationships implicitly. Yet, if the tool is unable to recognize those relationships, this makes it harder to retrieve relevant materials to think through later, either with yourself or others. In these cases, our tools don‚Äôt let us easily refactor, leading to high friction in reifying our ideas. There also may be an upper limit on the complexity of unintentional structure people can create. [*](((K191-xTMS)))\n- Some thought processors attempt to give their users **structure for free** by implicitly structuring the data from user behavior. These methods promise to make structuring ideas an intrinsic task. For example, outliner tools like Roam and Logseq embed implicit AND/OR relationships between blocks through indentation. Obsidian and other networked notebooks with wikilink autocompletion allow users to name and categorize ideas on the fly. Voiceliner allows you to signify the relative importance of notes by dragging your finger up and down the screen as you record. Jump creates a semantic graph in the background for you and is able to infer relationships and metadata to lighten the user's information entry requirements. [*](((lHtBYbfDV)))\n- However, some users feel restricted by tools that implicitly infer structure from the way that users write because the design is necessarily opinionated. For example, one participant told us that Roam Research was too opinionated when she tried it. You need a course to use it properly and end up indoctrinated into the Roam way of thinking. Her way of thinking is different, so there was a consistent mismatch.

[*](((9LwW0ZobI)))\n\t- In the early stages of synthesis, when people have [half-baked ideas not ready yet](half-baked%20ideas%20not%20ready%20yet), they prefer to work on their own or with a close companion. \n\t- For most people, the primary concern is speed.

This can only happen if you are able to leave out details as you go. When you are on your own or with a trusted collaborator with shared context, you do not need to re-explain things you already understand, using a \"shorthand\" instead.\n\t- \u003e First, we need to have the right people‚Äîor nobody‚Äîin the room. Either we‚Äôre working alone or with a trusted partner who can keep pace with us. Someone we can speak with in shorthand, who has the same background knowledge, and who we can be frank with as we jump between ideas.\n\t- Here, the primary concern is being able to [work at the speed of thought](work%20at%20the%20speed%20of%20thought). Bringing someone else up to speed - especially someone with a [lack of shared context](lack%20of%20shared%20context) - slows the process down and reduces the chances of advancing beyond the basics.  \n\t- This lack of shared context makes it difficult to divide the work of synthesis collaboratively. \n\t- [B1](B1) gave an example from his own experience where he was working on a knowledge graph project with people who did not have a background in knowledge graphs. They had 10 sources and divided them up so each person would look at different sources and take notes on them. When [B1](B1) read his sources, he took notes in the context of what was relevant to the project, whereas his collaborators would write summaries of the entire sources. They did not fully understand the driving questions and history of the space, so they had no filter for relevance.\n\t- [R2](R2) mentioned that when he reads a paper, he only takes notes on what is relevant for his current projects.

In simple terms, they know how to work with one another on the problem they're working on.   \n\t- But there is a very [significant barrier]([[[CLM](%5B%5BCLM) - Interdisciplinary teamwork is hard]]) to team-based [Convergence](Convergence) because of this bottleneck of not being able to have a shared \"dataset\" of ideas that satisfy the properties. Our external representations that are **shareable** lack one or more of those properties. [*](((79OcTyQZR))) [*](((9eAC3T91o)))\n\t- When we did see distributed synthesis in our research, people would almost always bring someone else into their work through a feedback role, as that lowers the burden of the shared dataset requirement.  [*](((HXYWjd8Jm)))\n\t- Instead of involving peers in the full synthesis process, [B5](B5) would ask concise questions to his peers that would support him  [B5](B5) and [R10](R10) seek feedback only from trusted individuals. TA comes up with a pitch, bringing people along his line of questioning. He wants to present others with a gateway into the topic he's exploring. \n\t- Oftentimes, his solution to get people up to speed is a **gateway analogy,** where he presents his idea through the lens of one his audience might understand.\n\t- In our interviews, virtually everyone struggled to bring other people up to speed on their projects, but the theme of a **collective narrative** emerged as a pattern of people who are on the same page.\n\t- At this point, the synthesizer would either find an individual with shared context, or they would need to come up with a concise framing to act as gateway analogies and simple entry points to share.[*](((qjcwxhvEe)))\n\t- To find those entry points, [B5](B5) considers the following questions: What's a common way to frame this that others can relate to? How can I get someone else to think this is their own idea? What will help someone else get it? What motivated the project?\n\t- Others talked about conversations as a framing mechanism to drive the process of synthesis.  [R16](R16) uses [conversations, chats with others](conversations,%20chats%20with%20others) as her primary form of synthesis. She finds the form of chat to be more conversational and feels its easier to solve a problem with an audience in mind or if you're talking to someone.  For her, the very act of framing the thoughts so her partner could understand clarifies her thinking.\n- ## Find or create shared context\n\t- This suggests two categories of solutions to enable synthesis with others:\n\t- **1. Connect people who share context.** This remains an area for further research, but obvious solutions include finding other people who write about similar concepts or enabling the formation of communities and querying for overlap between people.\n\t- **2. Design mechanisms to help people gain context quickly.** In order to do this, we would need to facilitate knowledge transfer from experts to beginners. This is a difficult problem. As described earlier, experts prefer to work on their own or with people who already share context **because** their ability to move fast depends on omitting the basics. Solutions to this problem will involve **lowering the barrier to add structure to notes.** \n\t- A promising direction would be through enhanced composability, see [C- Hypertext enables communication with high information density](C-%20Hypertext%20enables%20communication%20with%20high%20information%20density.md) for more detail.\n\t- On the more radical end, graph queries could show readers X number of paths to traverse between their current understanding and a page that they want to read. It could infer what people already know through a variety of mechanisms - what they have read already, what they've written, what they have commented on.\n","lastmodified":"2022-04-20T22:17:47.828173448Z","tags":null},"/notes/CJK-+-Latex-Support-%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95":{"title":"CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)","content":"## Chinese, Japanese, Korean Support\nÂá†‰πéÂú®Êàë‰ª¨ÊÑèËØÜÂà∞‰πãÂâçÔºåÊàë‰ª¨Â∑≤ÁªèÁ¶ªÂºÄ‰∫ÜÂú∞Èù¢„ÄÇ\n\nÏö∞Î¶¨Í∞Ä Í∑∏Í≤ÉÏùÑ ÏïåÍ∏∞ÎèÑ Ï†ÑÏóê Ïö∞Î¶¨Îäî ÎïÖÏùÑ Îñ†ÎÇ¨ÏäµÎãàÎã§.\n\nÁßÅ„Åü„Å°„Åå„Åù„Çå„ÇíÁü•„Çã„Åª„ÅºÂâç„Å´„ÄÅÁßÅ„Åü„Å°„ÅØÂú∞Èù¢„ÇíÈõ¢„Çå„Å¶„ÅÑ„Åæ„Åó„Åü„ÄÇ\n\n## Latex\n\nBlock math works with two dollar signs `$$...$$`\n\n$$f(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\n    f\\hat(\\xi),e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x}\n    \\,d\\xi$$\n\t\nInline math also works with single dollar signs `$...$`.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\nüêõ [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)","lastmodified":"2022-04-20T22:17:47.828173448Z","tags":null}}
